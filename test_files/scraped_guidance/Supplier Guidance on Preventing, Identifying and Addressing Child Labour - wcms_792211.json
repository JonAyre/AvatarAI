Introduction
1.1	Why a supplier guideline to prevent, identify and
address child labour and provide protection for
young workers?
Child labour harms children’s mental and physical development.
It also harms business and can lead to legal sanctions, a loss
of productivity, disruptions in production, and lost orders.
It has no place in a modern, competitive and sustainable
garment industry. This document provides practical guidance
for factories and other production sites to prevent child labour
through effective age verification and the protection of young
workers, and to effectively respond to it if it does occur.2

1.2 Key terms
The key terms used in this Guidance include:
ChildThe International Labour Organization (ILO) Worst Forms of Child
Labour Convention (No. 182) defines a child as all persons under
the age of 18
Child labourILO defines child labour as work that deprives children of their
childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to
physical and mental development. Child labour refers to one or
more of the following:
1) Work done by a child who is under the minimum age of
admission to employment for the type of work concerned;
2) W
 ork that interferes with compulsory education:
3) W
 ork that is likely to jeopardize a child’s health, safety or morals,
known as hazardous work;
4) O
 ther “worst forms of child labour” besides hazardous work.
Young workerFor the purposes of this guidance, “young worker” refers to a
person who has reached the minimum legal working age, usually
15, but is under 18 years old (still a child).

1.3 Key elements
Child labour is a violation of fundamental human rights. According to international standards, work
must not be performed by anyone under the minimum working age (usually 15 or higher if stipulated by
national law).1 ‘Work’ refers to any work at your company, including work done under apprenticeships,
or training and work/study schemes; it includes contractual, temporary or casual work, as well as on-site
subcontracted work (waste, catering, delivery, cleaning, building works, etc.). This guidance applies to all
production sites, including lower tier suppliers (e.g., material suppliers and subcontractors).

ILO Convention No. 138 sets a general minimum working age of 15, however it states that a country “…whose economy and educational
facilities are insufficiently developed may, after consultation with the organizations of employers and workers concerned, where such exist,
initially specify a minimum age of 14 years.” Some countries, however, have set a minimum age of 16 years.

X 2. Create a non-discrimitory but protective workplace for young workers
Definition: young workers are children above the legal minimum age for work and under 18.
See
section
3.1.1
Special management measures on
contracting: Young workers need
contracts just like adult ones, but
theirs should specifically mention
the extra protections applying to
them.
Make sure they are subject to
strong OSH protection and never
do hazardous work. To ensure this,
create a system to identify hazards
and assess risks for young workers.
See
section
3.2
Working hours: As a rule of thumb,
young workers should not work
overtime or nightshifts.
Create a low-risk environment for
young workers by:
X 1. Identifying low-risk jobs
X 2. Creating a list of low-risk tasks
& processes, consistent with
local law
See
section
3.1.2
X 3. Through long-term measures,
reducing the risk levels of more
positions to create more options
for youth
Take young workers’ needs
into account when setting
up your onboarding and
orientation training, and in your
communication.

awareness of factory
management and young
workers on how to create a safe

X 3. Child labour remediation (after identifying child labour)
If a child or young worker is
found to be in child labour,
seek together with your
buyers, and ideally an expert
organization, solutions that
are in the best interests of
the child or young worker
concerned.
When a young worker (above
the minimum working age
but under 18) is engaged
in hazardous work, the
following actions should be
taken:
1. Job re-allocation
2. Health check
3. Training for the young
worker
See
section
4.1
When a child below the
minimum age for work is
found at the production

should be taken:
1. Immediate actions,
including taking the child to
a safe place
2. Providing a living stipend
3. Enrolling him/her in a
suitable educational/

1.4 Guiding Principles
Preventing child labour and ensuring special protection for young workers under 18 is not always an
easy task and might not always follow the same pattern. Therefore, it is really important that you
follow the following set of principles, which will always apply no matter the case:
1.	Always apply the stricter law:
e.g., in a case where international standards
differ from the local law, always operate
based on the higher standards/stricter laws
which provide a higher level of protection (for
instance, if the local minimum age to work is
set at 16, and the international standard is 15,
you will have to apply the stricter of the two –
that is 16!).2.	Protect—but do not discriminate against—
young workers:
suppliers should protect young workers who
have reached the minimum working age, but
not exclude them from access to safe work.
Young workers should never be involved in
tasks that are included in “hazardous work
lists” in national law.
3.	Children have a right to be heard:
children’s opinion should be taken into
consideration in any decisions that concern
them.4.	All interventions are aimed at positively
impacting the child and his/her family:
our main concern should be to act in the best
interest of the children and to protect the
privacy of the children and their families.

Child labour prevention
Making age verification a central part of a clear employment policy, as well as
managing the risk associated with recruitment agencies and subcontracting
play a vital role in the prevention of child labour.2
2.1 The basics
Clearly state the minimum age
for general work and hazardous
work in your hiring policy and job
announcements, e.g., “in order to
work at our company, you need to be
a minimum of 15 years old for general
positions and a minimum of 18 years
to perform hazardous work”. Make
sure the minimum ages comply with
international or national legislation
(whichever provides greater
protection).Recruitment and hiring should
follow standardized procedures
and include a robust age
verification mechanism. Ensure that
recruitment and hiring, including
age verification, is handled by the
appropriate department (e.g., the
human resources or personnel
department), by people trained to
do so. Recruitment and hiring should
not be managed informally, e.g., by
a security guard, line supervisor, or
through family members.
Medical examinations are not an
appropriate means of verifying age.
Accuracy cannot be guaranteed, and
an examination may cause a child
unnecessary stress and violate his or
her right to privacy.4Manage the risk of child labour
linked with any rapid increases in
demand for labour or the use of
labour agents, subcontractors and
service providers.

Supplier guidance on preventing, identifying and addressing child labour
2.2 Steps to verify age
2.2.1 Pre-recruitment
Make sure your job announcements contain the following information:
X Expected education level
X Skills & experience required
X Minimum working age
Means of verifying age:
X Indicate that all applicants must present government-issued identification
documents to prove their age and identity; job announcements, application
forms and notices at the facility should state that applicants with false or
invalid documents will not be considered or hired.
If the advertised
position is hazardous
(e.g., requires
handling heavy
machinery);
you should indicate
this and set the
minimum working
age at 18. However,
setting a minimum
age of 18 for non-
hazardous work may
be discriminatory
and should be
avoided.
2.2.2 During recruitment
Thoroughly check (and cross-check) original proof of age documents.
Use the following steps:
If a reliable ID card is available:
X Make sure the photo and identity mark on the submitted documents match
the appearance of the applicant.
X Make sure the signature on the national ID card matches the applicant’s
signature.
X Check that the original seal between the photo and card is intact.
X The date of issue should broadly tally with the condition of the card. It is
suspicious if a card issued many years ago looks brand new.
If no ID card is available:
X Establish the most reliable form of documentation in your country and
request a minimum of two forms, such as a birth certificate, household
registry (family book), driver’s license, right to vote card, or work permit.
In countries where
a national identity
card is not available,
require applicants
to present two
documents to
verify their age;
examples include:
a birth certificate,
household registry
(family book), driver’s
license, right to vote
card, work permit,
or school testimony.
At least one of these
documents must
contain a photo ID.II. Child labour prevention
Additional elements to consider:
X Certain countries require that a government agency3 (e.g., the Ministry
of Labour) be informed when a young worker is recruited.
Note: When
interviewing young
applicants, age
verification must
not be based on
socially or culturally
constructed ideas of
what an adolescent
should look like, or
how they should
behave or respond to
particular situations,
as children’s physical
development varies
owing to factors
including diet, access
to health care, living
and environmental
conditions and
genes. Behaviour
also varies
according to cultural
backgrounds and
expectations.
X If you suspect forged documents or are presented with a temporary
identification card, check the document’s validity with local government
offices and request other forms of ID.
X Conduct in-person interviews with all applicants. At the interview,
applicants can be asked questions such as where their documents were
issued, where their father was born, or their date of birth. This information
can then be cross-checked with the card.
X Ensure that once the identity check has been completed the originals are
immediately returned to the applicants.
X If insufficient or suspicious ID is presented, support the applicant to
procure proper documents (e.g., by providing information on where/how
they can apply for proper identification documents).
2.2.3 After recruitment
Age verification does not stop with recruitment of staff. You should also
implement the following measures on an ongoing basis:
X Prepare and maintain a register4 of all workers’ application documents
and records of employment, including daily workers, temporary workers,
young workers and interns/apprentices or student workers. This should
include at a minimum:
• a valid labour contract;
• a copy of the worker’s ID card;
• a recent photo (taken within the past 6 months);
• date of employment;
• main task(s)/position;
• work schedule; and
• manager’s name.
X Records of non-national employees must include records confirming their
legal status and working permit.
X Provide all of your employees with a facility-issued photo ID.
X A face scanning attendance system or fingerprint identification attendance
system reduces the risk of persons assuming the identity of workers in the
facility.
3
The labour laws of China, Thailand and Singapore, for example, stipulate that employers are required to
inform the Ministry of Labour before young workers begin to work.
4
In compliance with ILO C138, suppliers shall have an official list or documents that contain the names and
ages or dates of birth, duly certified wherever possible of the workers who are below 18 years old and the list
shall be available to competent authorities.

Supplier guidance on preventing, identifying and addressing child labour
2.2.4 Managing risk factors
During peak seasons or labour shortages, when large numbers of workers are
in demand, proper hiring processes and age verification may be neglected.
Moreover, the use of labour agents, subcontractors and service providers
may also increase the risk of child labour. Below are a few measures to help
you to manage this situation.
X Ensure all your business partners are formally registered businesses.
X Include a child labour policy and procedure for prevention and remediation
in contracts with subcontractors and service providers.
X Update and maintain a subcontractors list. Regularly collect updated
information such as size of facility, production capacity and number of
workers.
X Avoid placing orders that exceed production capacity, taking into
consideration orders placed by other customers.
X Keep a record of workers hired by service providers as well as the relevant
documents.
X If you engage labour recruiters, use only reputable companies that comply
with all relevant laws.
X Verify the documents and interview workers in your facilities, even when
you have not directly hired the workers. For your buyers, it will NOT make
a difference if the workers in your facilities are directly hired by you or
by a labour agent. This applies to any person working in your facilities
and includes situations in which you outsource production lines, waste
management, canteen services, security, dorm services etc.
X No recruitment fees or related costs should be charged to workers or
jobseekers.

III.
Management of young
workers
Young workers below the age of 18 require special protection, but they are also valuable
employees who form the basis of your company’s future.
You should have systems in place to ensure a non-discriminatory but protective workplace
for young workers, in which their occupational safety and health (OSH) is ensured. This
includes implementing specific measures on contracting, working hours, onboarding
and orientation, communication and ongoing OSH protection specifically aimed at young
workers (see section 3.1). A system to identify hazards and assess risks (section 3.2)
is essential in order to create a safe working environment for young workers (see section 3.3).
3.1	Establishing special protective measures
for young workers
Adolescence is a time of dramatic physical and mental change and huge developmental strides.
Young workers therefore need special protection at the workplace. Some of the reasons for
this are:
X Young workers need more oxygen. They breathe in more air (and therefore any toxic
substances/pollutants and airborne diseases that may be present) relative to fully-grown
adults.
X They face health risks when assigned tasks beyond their physical capabilities, which
can lead to developmental problems and injuries. They are generally eager to please,
lack experience and their judgement is still in the process of developing. Without training
they may be more prone to taking risks.
X They need more sleep than adults. Quantity and quality of sleep directly affects young
people’s cognitive development. They must not work long hours, while work and study
programmes and vocational training must leave them time for enough sleep.
1314
Supplier guidance on preventing, identifying and addressing child labour
3.1.1 Hiring young workers
As outlined in section 2.2, robust systems for age verification are key. Once you have
established that the applicant is of working age but under 18, take the following steps:
X Ensure the young worker has a valid contract just like an adult worker. It should include
standard terms of remuneration and benefits but also special protections related to
safety and health, working hours, rest time and leave, etc. See Annex III for a detailed list
of contract conditions.
X Ensure that all young workers fully understand the terms and conditions of their
contracts. The contract should be in a language understood by the worker.
3.1.2 Working hours
Many countries have specific working hour regulations for young workers (see Annex IV).
Unless your country’s regulations are stricter, you should respect the following guidelines:
X No night work for young workers (night work may be allowed as of 16 if necessary, for
learning purposes during an apprenticeship, if such apprenticeship is approved by the
competent government authority, the apprentice receives training and is allowed at least
13 hours’ rest between shifts. Of course, the work must not be otherwise hazardous).
X No overtime.
X At least 12 consecutive hours of night rest each day.
X If the young worker is still in compulsory education, their work must not interfere with
their school attendance nor the ability to study.
3.1.3	The first day of work for young workers: Orientation and occupational
safety & health training
Arrange an orientation and OSH training for all young workers before they begin
work, which includes a review of all key terms of employment (contract, hours, factory
regulations). Small group training, with interactive sessions and hands-on practice help
ensure full understanding of your factory’s OSH policies and regulations. Training should
include:
X A clear message to ensure young workers understand the importance of safety in the
workplace.
X A ‘walk and talk’ safety tour for young workers highlighting particular safety concerns.
X Review of legal requirements for the protection of young workers, e.g., regular health
examination, working hours and types of work, processes or positions they CAN and
CANNOT do.
X Explanation of existing OSH risk control measures, e.g., signage for hazards, and
resources available to support the health and safety of young workers.
X Explanation of procedures for reporting workplace hazards/dangerous situations and
the follow-up steps to be taken to eliminate reported hazards.
X Explanation of procedures for evacuation in case of an emergency.III. Management of young workers
3.1.4 Ongoing protection during employment
What are the
elements for an
effective grievance
system?
Find out in
Annex V
Receiving feedback, concerns, complaints, suggestions and questions from
young workers is a good way to identify real or potential risks and hazards and
to ensure workers are protected. An effective grievance system accessible to
young workers is essential in this regard.
Trade unions can provide a valuable channel for relaying feedback and grievances,
anonymously and without fear of reprisal. In addition, if not already in place,
consider establishing an OSH Committee involving workers and management.
Other channels may include accessible welfare officers, anonymous suggestion
boxes, hotlines, and web-based platforms (such as email, SMS, app, online surveys)
that are easily accessible to workers.
3.2	Identifying hazardous work and conducting risk
assessment for young workers
A sound OSH system identifies hazards associated with the tasks and processes in
which young workers are engaged, and estimates how likely it is that the hazard
will cause them harm. This process is essential to managing risk and keeping young
workers safe.
3.2.1	Identify hazardous work tasks and processes
and necessary protection measures
You should have
a detailed list of
all work tasks
and processes.
Ensure that this
list distinguishes
between similar tasks
and processes that
are found at different
workplaces. This is
important because,
for example, a task
that is not in itself
hazardous could
become hazardous
if located in an area
with high levels of
dust, noise, heat or
chemical usage.
Production observation
Walk through facilities with your key staff (production managers, HR, supervisors,
compliance & OSH experts) to identify hazardous tasks and processes, bearing
in mind national law and international labour standards.
Make sure the walk-through considers:
X Activities of all persons having access to the workplace (including contractors
and visitors) including processing, materials storage, finished products, public
areas, offices, visiting areas and transport vehicles.
X Infrastructure, equipment and materials at the workplace, whether provided
by the factory or others.
X The design of work areas, processes, installations, machinery/equipment,
operating procedures and work organization.
X Planned and temporary work.
X Long-term hazards (e.g., high levels of noise or exposure to harmful
substances).
X Psychosocial hazards such as harassment.

Supplier guidance on preventing, identifying and addressing child labour
Manufacturers’ instructions
Check manufacturers’ instructions for equipment and safety data sheets
(SDS) for chemicals, as they can be very helpful in identifying hazards.
Worker and expert interviews
Talk to workers, young workers and their representatives to obtain first-hand
experiences about the risks and hazards of different jobs. Workers may have
noticed hazards that are not immediately obvious. Speak to OSH experts who
have experience in the garment industry.
Conduct individual or group interviews with workers, young workers and
their representatives. Prepare questions before the interviews to explore
potential risks and hazards (see Annex VI).
Review previous accident reports
Reports on accidents and work-related ill health can help identify less obvious
hazards. For reference, Annex VII provides a detailed list of common hazards in
the garment and textile industry.

3.2.2 Risk assessment for identified hazards
After hazards have been identified, assess the risk arising from them (a risk assessment). Risk is defined
as “a combination of the likelihood of an occurrence of a hazardous event (probability) and the severity
of injury or damage to the health of people caused by this event (severity)”. Risk assessments will enable
you to assign a risk level (low to high) to individual tasks and processes, and take preventive action.
Firstly, the probability of the harm is estimated by rating it as “Likely”, “Possible” or “Unlikely”.
X Probability
X Frequency of an event
LikelyCould happen frequently
PossibleCould happen occasionally
UnlikelyMay occur in exceptional circumstances
Please note: If there is any injury or accident mentioned in accident reports, the rating should be “likely”.
Secondly, the degree of impact that may be caused by the harm is estimated by rating it as “High”,
“Moderate” and “Low”.
X Severity of harm
X Type of potential harm event (incident)
HIGH	A high potential of causing fatality, permanent disability
Significant level of harm
or long-term and serious injury.
MODERATE
Moderate level of harmPotential to cause serious but non-life-threatening injuries
or temporary disability, that may require the worker to
take time off for recovery. A broken arm or minor fracture 		
is an example of a moderate injury.
LOW
Minor level of harmVery low potential of injury or illness that will not require
a person to use first aid, or to temporarily suspend their
work involvement.
And then the risk can be assessed as “High”, “Medium” or “Low”, according to the combination of
severity and probability.
Level of risk = severity of harm x probability of harm

3.3.2 Develop a list for low risk tasks and processes
Based on your risk assessment you can now take the following steps:
X Analyse the low risk work tasks and processes (see Annex IX).
X Create a list of work from the “Low risk” category that is safe for young workers and
complies with applicable laws.
X Develop an action plan: identify gaps in current OSH management such as policy,
procedure, communication and training; formulate corrective measures and a timeline;
assign responsible staff; initiate corrective action, and monitor the progress.
X Conduct regular assessments (or whenever there are changes to existing process) and
update the low risk task list.
X Store and file risk assessment results and the low risk task list for easy reference.
You will find a table template table in (Annex X) to help you with that process.III. Management of young workers
3.3.3 Long-term measures
Effectively protecting young workers from hazardous work may mean physically removing a hazard,
isolating workers from hazards, changing work processes and procedures, or providing improved
working conditions. For more details on this process you may consult Annex XI.
3.3.4 Continuously raise awareness of factory management and young workers
In conjunction with OSH committees and trade unions, where present, ensure that awareness raising
and OSH training, taking into account the extra need for protection of young workers, is undertaken on
an ongoing basis. It is important to conduct regular monitoring in order to ensure compliance in daily
operations.
X How a factory adjusted tasks and processes to accommodate young workers
Good
practice
ABC Packaging Co., Ltd. (note 1) is a factory that produces backpacks and bags for many US
and European buyers, and they are one of the first factories in Vietnam to hire young workers
under the age of 18. Before hiring young workers, the factory started identifying suitable jobs
that were low risk and safe for young workers. However, the location and the work settings
of these jobs was likely to jeopardize the health of the young workers. To create a safe and
decent working environment for young workers, the factory conducted a job analysis and the
following risk/challenge control measures were taken:
TaskHazards/challengesElimination/minimization of risk
1Thread trimmingErgonomic hazard: Work while
standing full time on a high

As a result, no one considered

these positions as suitable
positions for young workers.More tasks were identified as suitable,
so that young workers could do at
least two tasks in the same work area,
thus allowing them to rotate to the
other task when one of the tasks was
completed.
4Food preparation
and serving in the
canteensSafety hazard: Risk of fire and
burns in the kitchen and from
hot foodIdentify restricted area and non-

risks for young workers.
After the risks were removed and the work setting was re-adjusted, more non-hazardous jobs were
created for young workers and the factory successfully allocated suitable tasks to them.
19© Center for Child Rights and Corporate Social Responsibility (CCR CSR).IV. Child labour remediation
IV.
Child labour remediation
Child labour remediation refers to the process of removing a child from a child labour
situation to ensure safe and adequate alternatives for them, such as reintegrating them
into the education system or, if they are above the minimum age for work, creating an
opportunity for them to work in a non-hazardous job.
4.1	What should you do when a young worker (above the
minimum working age but under 18) is engaged in
hazardous work?
If young workers are found working in hazardous tasks or processes:
X Remove the young workers from the hazard.
X Offer them access to “low risk” work, without reducing salary or benefits.
X Arrange health checks and ensure any necessary treatment is provided, including for
long term exposure to hazards (e.g., dust, vibration, excessive noise).
X Monitor the young worker’s situation regularly to ensure that children do not gradually
shift back to high-risk activities.
2122
Supplier guidance on preventing, identifying and addressing child labour
4.2	What should you do when a child below the general minimum
age for work is found at the production facility?
An underage worker may be identified by staff or other parties at the production site, or a child may
accompany their parents or guardians to the production facilities and can either be playing or helping
their parents with some tasks to be kept busy. The first thing to do is ensure that the child is safe and
does not feel in any way threatened or scared by the situation. It is often preferable that a woman speaks
with the child, particularly in the case of girls.5
4.2.1 When a child below the general minimum age is working in the production facility
you should:
X Talk to the child in a calm manner, offer information about yourself and ask open-ended, general
questions to establish a rapport. Listen to the child to understand their needs. Assure them that
they have done nothing wrong and are not “in trouble”. In a kind manner explain why they can’t be
working.
X Remove the child from the workstation and arrange a safe place for the child e.g., office room,
dormitory or home.
X Contact the child’s parents/guardians and explain the situation to them.
X Ensure that the child has been paid for the time worked in the factory.
X Good practice is to provide financial support to the child and their family to cover school fees and
living costs until the child reaches the end of compulsory schooling or the minimum age for work,
then rehiring the young worker to do non-hazardous work.
X Document and keep records of each child labour case.
X If a local remediation expert is involved, inform the expert about the child labour case with a Child
Labour Notification Form (Annex XII), and support and cooperate with the expert on the child’s
remediation.
X If no local experts are available, you may seek support from ILO offices and other UN agencies such
as UNICEF for guidance.
4.2.2 What to do when an auditor or buyer detects a child below the minimum age for
work
If a child below the minimum age is found during a factory audit, a remediation process will be initiated
with the involvement of the buyer. You are expected to:
X Fill in the Child Labour Notification Form (Annex XII), and cooperate with and support the child
labour remediation process. A local remediation expert will:
• interview the child concerned and their parents;
• interview factory management and review relevant documents;
• conduct a factory walkthrough; and
•	if no local experts are available, you may seek support from ILO offices and other UN agencies
such as UNICEF for guidance.

For detailed guidance on interviewing children removed from child labour see: ILO: Psycho-social rehabilitation of children withdrawn
from trafficking and other worst forms of child labour (Geneva,2007). Available at: https://www.ilo.org/ipec/Informationresources/WCMS_
IPEC_PUB_14755/lang--en/index.htm.IV. Child labour remediation
X Discuss the cost of a remediation programme with buyers and subcontractors if they are involved.
The cost usually includes:
• a stipend for the child;
• education fees for the child;
• additional training in child rights and child worker policies at the factory; and
• the local expert’s costs to monitor the factory.
4.2.3 What to do when a supplier or factory staff find a child in the factory who is not
working
If a child is not working but is present in the production facility due to parents lacking alternatives for
childcare, the supplier should:
X Speak kindly to the parents (if they are present) and explain why the child cannot be in the factory
and.
X Contact the child’s parents/guardians if they are not with the child.
X Remove the child from the workplace and arrange a safe place for the child e.g., child friendly
space, office room, dormitory or home.
X Explore whether the parents/guardians need childcare services.
X If the factory has a day-care or a child-friendly space (a space with adult supervision where children
can play and do homework), place the child there.
X If the factory does not have a day-care or a child-friendly space, assist the parents by connecting
them to local childcare services or a relevant organization.
X Document and keep a record of the case.
Good
practice
X Child friendly space eliminates parents’ need to bring their children
with them to the production floor
A factory in China had a large migrant workforce, many of whom were parents. During
the summer months when their children were off school, parent workers found
themselves without any viable childcare options while they worked. As a result, some
brought their children to the production floor, believing the children to be safer by their
side than unaccompanied at home. During an audit however, the children were flagged
as underage workers.
To prevent such problems in summers thereafter, the factory opened a Child Friendly
Space on their premises. This provided workers’ children with a safe space to spend
their summer holidays, while the parents could put their mind to rest and concentrate
on work. The programme proved to be a win-win solution: the children had a much
more interesting, fun, social and educational summer by doing arts and crafts, playing
games and taking part in parent-child activities than if they had stayed at home; par-
ents did not have to pay hefty childcare fees or take time off work to look after their
children; and the factory enjoyed lower absenteeism and turnover, and a happier, more
motivated workforce.

Annex II.
Good practices for age verification
Elements of a good age verification system must have:
X Effective Child Labour Policy and Procedures in place (which include age verification), which are in
line with business partners’ requirements.
X HR staff trained on legal requirements who can carry out age verification as required and identify
the authenticity of the ID documents.
X Responsible person appointed, who has the authority and resources to regularly supervise the age
verification process.
X Risk control measures in place, concerning resources utilized in hiring and operating processes,
including management of labour agents, subcontractors and sub-contract partners.

maintaining a list of hazardous work, a regularly updated list of young workers, onsite checks to
ensure no young workers are engaged in hazardous work.
X Budget in place to allow for child labour prevention training and skills on age verification.
Sample questions related to age verification (to be used in addition to requested age verification
documents):
Questions related to age should be natural and may start with a casual chat about the family situation.
X Can you talk a bit about yourself? Where is your hometown? Do you like school? Why? Or why not?
Do you have to send money back home?
X How many members are in your family? What are your parents’ names?
X What are your parents doing? Where are they?
X Do you have siblings? Are they studying or working? How many years older/younger than you are
your siblings?
X What is your birthday by day, month and year? So, in this case, how old are you?
X What’s your animal sign/zodiac animal? What about the animal sign of your siblings?
X When did you start junior middle school? Have you ever skipped a grade or been held back a grade?
X Which grade did you finish and when? In which grade are your siblings? Or when did they finish
school and at what grade?
X Was this a school in your hometown? Where is it?
X Do you have friends from the same hometown/school here? Do you still keep in contact with your
classmates? In which grade are your classmates now if some are still in school?
X Did you ever move from one place to another place? How old were you when you moved?
X Is this your first job? Have you ever worked before? What kind of job have you done before? How
long did you work for in the last job?
X Have your heard from your parents if any important event occurred in the year you were born? If
yes, what?

Annex XI.
Long-term best practice to prevent potential harm to young workers
The following best practices aim to prevent potential harm to young workers on a long-term basis.
You should seek solutions in compliance with national laws and regulations to transform the tasks and
processes from “Medium Risk” to “Low Risk” by following the suggested order below. This chart provides
guidance and methods to remove or eliminate identified hazards and control risk in the most effective
way.
Ways of risk controlDefinitions
Elimination and
substitutionPhysically remove the hazard or replace the part/component
which performs similar functions but is safer to use
Engineering controlsIsolate people from hazards, but hazards still exist
Most Effective Risk
Control Measure
Change the way people work through procedure changes,
Administrative controls employee training, and installation of signs, warning labels,
and so on
Hygiene and welfareInstall and provide hygiene and welfare facilities to cope with
the risks to reduce the effects that are caused by the hazards
Personal protective
equipmentProvide workers with PPE such as gloves, Nomex/uniform,
respirators, hard hats, safety glasses, high-visibility clothing,
and safety footwear
Least Effective Risk
Control Measure
Wherever possible, hazards should be eliminated. If this is not possible look for the next most effective
risk control measure until the position can be rated as low risk. It is important to note that in most cases,
the use of PPE to protect young workers from hazards is not sufficient.
Here are a few examples of concrete actions of removing or eliminating hazards and reducing risk:
X Removing or eliminating the risk or hazard completely, e.g., changing the composition of
components, materials etc., or changing work processes to a non-hazardous process; investing in
newer and safer machines with better risk control etc.
X Modifying workstations or the layout of the production line to protect young workers from
overheating, dust or hazardous chemicals.
X Putting controls in place to stop young workers from coming into contact with the hazard (such as
protective shields on machinery).
X Redesigning and setting up workstations to minimize bodily strain. This includes seating and
standing arrangements and the reach required to obtain tools.
X Signage/warnings in a language or medium understood by all workers and/or administrative
controls; implement administrative controls to prevent people from coming into contact with the
hazard, such as marked areas to keep people away from hazardous machines or machine parts;
and graphics for hazardous substances to alert workers to stay away.
