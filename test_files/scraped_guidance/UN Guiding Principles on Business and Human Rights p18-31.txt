     "content": "II.	The corporate responsibility to respect
human rights
A.
Foundational principles
11.	
Business enterprises should respect human rights. This means that
they should avoid infringing on the human rights of others and should
address adverse human rights impacts with which they are involved.
Commentary
The responsibility to respect human rights is a global standard of expected
conduct for all business enterprises wherever they operate. It exists
independently of States’ abilities and/or willingness to fulfil their own
human rights obligations, and does not diminish those obligations. And
it exists over and above compliance with national laws and regulations
protecting human rights.
Addressing adverse human rights impacts requires taking adequate measures
for their prevention, mitigation and, where appropriate, remediation.
Business enterprises may undertake other commitments or activities to
support and promote human rights, which may contribute to the enjoyment
of rights. But this does not offset a failure to respect human rights throughout
their operations.
Business enterprises should not undermine States’ abilities to meet their
own human rights obligations, including by actions that might weaken the
integrity of judicial processes.
12.	The responsibility of business enterprises to respect human rights refers
to internationally recognized human rights – understood, at a minimum,
as those expressed in the International Bill of Human Rights and the
principles concerning fundamental rights set out in the International
Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and
Rights at Work.
Commentary
Because business enterprises can have an impact on virtually the entire
spectrum of internationally recognized human rights, their responsibility to14
respect applies to all such rights. In practice, some human rights may be
at greater risk than others in particular industries or contexts, and therefore
will be the focus of heightened attention. However, situations may change,
so all human rights should be the subject of periodic review.
An authoritative list of the core internationally recognized human rights
is contained in the International Bill of Human Rights (consisting of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the main instruments through
which it has been codified: the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights), coupled with the principles concerning fundamental rights in the
eight ILO core conventions as set out in the Declaration on Fundamental
Principles and Rights at Work. These are the benchmarks against which
other social actors assess the human rights impacts of business enterprises.
The responsibility of business enterprises to respect human rights is distinct
from issues of legal liability and enforcement, which remain defined largely
by national law provisions in relevant jurisdictions.
Depending on circumstances, business enterprises may need to consider
additional standards. For instance, enterprises should respect the human
rights of individuals belonging to specific groups or populations that require
particular attention, where they may have adverse human rights impacts
on them. In this connection, United Nations instruments have elaborated
further on the rights of indigenous peoples; women; national or ethnic,
religious and linguistic minorities; children; persons with disabilities; and
migrant workers and their families. Moreover, in situations of armed conflict
enterprises should respect the standards of international humanitarian law.
13.	
The responsibility to respect human rights requires that business
enterprises:
		(a)	
Avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts
through their own activities, and address such impacts when they
occur;
		(b)	Seek to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are
directly linked to their operations, products or services by their
business relationships, even if they have not contributed to those
impacts.15
Commentary
Business enterprises may be involved with adverse human rights impacts either
through their own activities or as a result of their business relationships with
other parties. Guiding Principle 19 elaborates further on the implications for
how business enterprises should address these situations. For the purpose of
these Guiding Principles a business enterprise’s “activities” are understood
to include both actions and omissions; and its “business relationships” are
understood to include relationships with business partners, entities in its
value chain, and any other non-State or State entity directly linked to its
business operations, products or services.
14.	The responsibility of business enterprises to respect human rights applies
to all enterprises regardless of their size, sector, operational context,
ownership and structure. Nevertheless, the scale and complexity of
the means through which enterprises meet that responsibility may
vary according to these factors and with the severity of the enterprise’s
adverse human rights impacts.
Commentary
The means through which a business enterprise meets its responsibility to
respect human rights will be proportional to, among other factors, its size.
Small and medium-sized enterprises may have less capacity as well as more
informal processes and management structures than larger companies, so
their respective policies and processes will take on different forms. But some
small and medium-sized enterprises can have severe human rights impacts,
which will require corresponding measures regardless of their size. Severity
of impacts will be judged by their scale, scope and irremediable character.
The means through which a business enterprise meets its responsibility to
respect human rights may also vary depending on whether, and the extent
to which, it conducts business through a corporate group or individually.
However, the responsibility to respect human rights applies fully and equally
to all business enterprises.
15.	In order to meet their responsibility to respect human rights, business
enterprises should have in place policies and processes appropriate to
their size and circumstances, including:16
		(a)	A policy commitment to meet their responsibility to respect human
rights;
		(b)	A human rights due diligence process to identify, prevent, mitigate
and account for how they address their impacts on human rights;
		(c)	Processes to enable the remediation of any adverse human rights
impacts they cause or to which they contribute.
Commentary
Business enterprises need to know and show that they respect human rights.
They cannot do so unless they have certain policies and processes in place.
Principles 16 to 24 elaborate further on these.
B.
Operational principles
Policy commitment
16.	As the basis for embedding their responsibility to respect human rights,
business enterprises should express their commitment to meet this
responsibility through a statement of policy that:
		(a) Is approved at the most senior level of the business enterprise;
		(b) Is informed by relevant internal and/or external expertise;
		(c)	Stipulates the enterprise’s human rights expectations of personnel,
business partners and other parties directly linked to its operations,
products or services;
		(d)	Is publicly available and communicated internally and externally
to all personnel, business partners and other relevant parties;
		(e)	Is reflected in operational policies and procedures necessary to
embed it throughout the business enterprise.
Commentary
The term “statement” is used generically, to describe whatever means an
enterprise employs to set out publicly its responsibilities, commitments, and
expectations.
The level of expertise required to ensure that the policy statement is adequately
informed will vary according to the complexity of the business enterprise’s17
operations. Expertise can be drawn from various sources, ranging from
credible online or written resources to consultation with recognized experts.
The statement of commitment should be publicly available. It should be
communicated actively to entities with which the enterprise has contractual
relationships; others directly linked to its operations, which may include
State security forces; investors; and, in the case of operations with significant
human rights risks, to the potentially affected stakeholders.
Internal communication of the statement and of related policies and
procedures should make clear what the lines and systems of accountability
will be, and should be supported by any necessary training for personnel
in relevant business functions.
Just as States should work towards policy coherence, so business enterprises
need to strive for coherence between their responsibility to respect human
rights and policies and procedures that govern their wider business
activities and relationships. This should include, for example, policies
and procedures that set financial and other performance incentives for
personnel; procurement practices; and lobbying activities where human
rights are at stake.
Through these and any other appropriate means, the policy statement
should be embedded from the top of the business enterprise through all its
functions, which otherwise may act without awareness or regard for human
rights.
Human rights due diligence
17.	In order to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for how they address
their adverse human rights impacts, business enterprises should carry
out human rights due diligence. The process should include assessing
actual and potential human rights impacts, integrating and acting upon
the findings, tracking responses, and communicating how impacts are
addressed. Human rights due diligence:
		
(a)	
Should cover adverse human rights impacts that the business
enterprise may cause or contribute to through its own activities, or
which may be directly linked to its operations, products or services
by its business relationships;18
		(b)	Will vary in complexity with the size of the business enterprise, the
risk of severe human rights impacts, and the nature and context of
its operations;
		(c)	Should be ongoing, recognizing that the human rights risks may
change over time as the business enterprise’s operations and
operating context evolve.
Commentary
This Principle defines the parameters for human rights due diligence, while
Principles 18 through 21 elaborate its essential components.
Human rights risks are understood to be the business enterprise’s potential
adverse human rights impacts. Potential impacts should be addressed
through prevention or mitigation, while actual impacts – those that have
already occurred – should be a subject for remediation (Principle 22).
Human rights due diligence can be included within broader enterprise risk-
management systems, provided that it goes beyond simply identifying and
managing material risks to the company itself, to include risks to rights-holders.
Human rights due diligence should be initiated as early as possible in the
development of a new activity or relationship, given that human rights risks
can be increased or mitigated already at the stage of structuring contracts
or other agreements, and may be inherited through mergers or acquisitions.
Where business enterprises have large numbers of entities in their value
chains it may be unreasonably difficult to conduct due diligence for adverse
human rights impacts across them all. If so, business enterprises should
identify general areas where the risk of adverse human rights impacts is
most significant, whether due to certain suppliers’ or clients’ operating
context, the particular operations, products or services involved, or other
relevant considerations, and prioritize these for human rights due diligence.
Questions of complicity may arise when a business enterprise contributes
to, or is seen as contributing to, adverse human rights impacts caused by
other parties. Complicity has both non-legal and legal meanings. As a non-
legal matter, business enterprises may be perceived as being “complicit” in
the acts of another party where, for example, they are seen to benefit from
an abuse committed by that party.19
As a legal matter, most national jurisdictions prohibit complicity in the
commission of a crime, and a number allow for criminal liability of business
enterprises in such cases. Typically, civil actions can also be based on
an enterprise’s alleged contribution to a harm, although these may not
be framed in human rights terms. The weight of international criminal law
jurisprudence indicates that the relevant standard for aiding and abetting
is knowingly providing practical assistance or encouragement that has a
substantial effect on the commission of a crime.
Conducting appropriate human rights due diligence should help business
enterprises address the risk of legal claims against them by showing that
they took every reasonable step to avoid involvement with an alleged human
rights abuse. However, business enterprises conducting such due diligence
should not assume that, by itself, this will automatically and fully absolve
them from liability for causing or contributing to human rights abuses.
18.	In order to gauge human rights risks, business enterprises should identify
and assess any actual or potential adverse human rights impacts with
which they may be involved either through their own activities or as a
result of their business relationships. This process should:
		(a)	
Draw on internal and/or independent external human rights
expertise;
		(b)	Involve meaningful consultation with potentially affected groups
and other relevant stakeholders, as appropriate to the size of the
business enterprise and the nature and context of the operation.
Commentary
The initial step in conducting human rights due diligence is to identify
and assess the nature of the actual and potential adverse human rights
impacts with which a business enterprise may be involved. The purpose
is to understand the specific impacts on specific people, given a specific
context of operations. Typically this includes assessing the human rights
context prior to a proposed business activity, where possible; identifying
who may be affected; cataloguing the relevant human rights standards and
issues; and projecting how the proposed activity and associated business
relationships could have adverse human rights impacts on those identified.20
In this process, business enterprises should pay special attention to any
particular human rights impacts on individuals from groups or populations
that may be at heightened risk of vulnerability or marginalization, and bear
in mind the different risks that may be faced by women and men.
While processes for assessing human rights impacts can be incorporated
within other processes such as risk assessments or environmental and social
impact assessments, they should include all internationally recognized
human rights as a reference point, since enterprises may potentially impact
virtually any of these rights.
Because human rights situations are dynamic, assessments of human
rights impacts should be undertaken at regular intervals: prior to a new
activity or relationship; prior to major decisions or changes in the operation
(e.g. market entry, product launch, policy change, or wider changes to
the business); in response to or anticipation of changes in the operating
environment (e.g. rising social tensions); and periodically throughout the
life of an activity or relationship.
To enable business enterprises to assess their human rights impacts
accurately, they should seek to understand the concerns of potentially
affected stakeholders by consulting them directly in a manner that takes into
account language and other potential barriers to effective engagement.
In situations where such consultation is not possible, business enterprises
should consider reasonable alternatives such as consulting credible,
independent expert resources, including human rights defenders and others
from civil society.
The assessment of human rights impacts informs subsequent steps in the
human rights due diligence process.
19.	In order to prevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts, business
enterprises should integrate the findings from their impact assessments
across relevant internal functions and processes, and take appropriate
action.
		
(a) Effective integration requires that:
			
(i)	Responsibility for addressing such impacts is assigned to the
appropriate level and function within the business enterprise;21
			
		
(ii)	
Internal decision-making, budget allocations and oversight
processes enable effective responses to such impacts.
(b) Appropriate action will vary according to:
			(i)	Whether the business enterprise causes or contributes to an
adverse impact, or whether it is involved solely because the
impact is directly linked to its operations, products or services
by a business relationship;
			(ii) The extent of its leverage in addressing the adverse impact.
Commentary
The horizontal integration across the business enterprise of specific findings
from assessing human rights impacts can only be effective if its human
rights policy commitment has been embedded into all relevant business
functions. This is required to ensure that the assessment findings are properly
understood, given due weight, and acted upon.
In assessing human rights impacts, business enterprises will have looked
for both actual and potential adverse impacts. Potential impacts should be
prevented or mitigated through the horizontal integration of findings across
the business enterprise, while actual impacts—those that have already
occurred – should be a subject for remediation (Principle 22).
Where a business enterprise causes or may cause an adverse human rights
impact, it should take the necessary steps to cease or prevent the impact.
Where a business enterprise contributes or may contribute to an adverse
human rights impact, it should take the necessary steps to cease or prevent
its contribution and use its leverage to mitigate any remaining impact to
the greatest extent possible. Leverage is considered to exist where the
enterprise has the ability to effect change in the wrongful practices of an
entity that causes a harm.
Where a business enterprise has not contributed to an adverse human
rights impact, but that impact is nevertheless directly linked to its
operations, products or services by its business relationship with another
entity, the situation is more complex. Among the factors that will enter
into the determination of the appropriate action in such situations are the22
enterprise’s leverage over the entity concerned, how crucial the relationship
is to the enterprise, the severity of the abuse, and whether terminating
the relationship with the entity itself would have adverse human rights
consequences.
The more complex the situation and its implications for human rights, the
stronger is the case for the enterprise to draw on independent expert advice
in deciding how to respond.
If the business enterprise has leverage to prevent or mitigate the adverse
impact, it should exercise it. And if it lacks leverage there may be ways for
the enterprise to increase it. Leverage may be increased by, for example,
offering capacity-building or other incentives to the related entity, or
collaborating with other actors.
There are situations in which the enterprise lacks the leverage to prevent
or mitigate adverse impacts and is unable to increase its leverage. Here,
the enterprise should consider ending the relationship, taking into account
credible assessments of potential adverse human rights impacts of doing so.
Where the relationship is “crucial” to the enterprise, ending it raises further
challenges. A relationship could be deemed as crucial if it provides a
product or service that is essential to the enterprise’s business, and for which
no reasonable alternative source exists. Here the severity of the adverse
human rights impact must also be considered: the more severe the abuse,
the more quickly the enterprise will need to see change before it takes a
decision on whether it should end the relationship. In any case, for as long
as the abuse continues and the enterprise remains in the relationship, it
should be able to demonstrate its own ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact
and be prepared to accept any consequences – reputational, financial or
legal – of the continuing connection.
20.	In order to verify whether adverse human rights impacts are being
addressed, business enterprises should track the effectiveness of their
response. Tracking should:
		(a) Be based on appropriate qualitative and quantitative indicators;
		(b)	
Draw on feedback from both internal and external sources,
including affected stakeholders.23
Commentary
Tracking is necessary in order for a business enterprise to know if its human
rights policies are being implemented optimally, whether it has responded
effectively to the identified human rights impacts, and to drive continuous
improvement.
Business enterprises should make particular efforts to track the effectiveness
of their responses to impacts on individuals from groups or populations that
may be at heightened risk of vulnerability or marginalization.
Tracking should be integrated into relevant internal reporting processes.
Business enterprises might employ tools they already use in relation to
other issues. This could include performance contracts and reviews as well
as surveys and audits, using gender-disaggregated data where relevant.
Operational-level grievance mechanisms can also provide important
feedback on the effectiveness of the business enterprise’s human rights due
diligence from those directly affected (see Principle 29).
21.	In order to account for how they address their human rights impacts,
business enterprises should be prepared to communicate this externally,
particularly when concerns are raised by or on behalf of affected
stakeholders. Business enterprises whose operations or operating
contexts pose risks of severe human rights impacts should report
formally on how they address them. In all instances, communications
should:
		(a)	Be of a form and frequency that reflect an enterprise’s human
rights impacts and that are accessible to its intended audiences;
		(b)	Provide information that is sufficient to evaluate the adequacy of
an enterprise’s response to the particular human rights impact
involved;
		(c)	In turn not pose risks to affected stakeholders, personnel or to
legitimate requirements of commercial confidentiality.
Commentary
The responsibility to respect human rights requires that business enterprises
have in place policies and processes through which they can both know24
and show that they respect human rights in practice. Showing involves
communication, providing a measure of transparency and accountability
to individuals or groups who may be impacted and to other relevant
stakeholders, including investors.
Communication can take a variety of forms, including in-person meetings,
online dialogues, consultation with affected stakeholders, and formal
public reports. Formal reporting is itself evolving, from traditional annual
reports and corporate responsibility/sustainability reports, to include online
updates and integrated financial and non-financial reports.
Formal reporting by enterprises is expected where risks of severe human
rights impacts exist, whether this is due to the nature of the business
operations or operating contexts. The reporting should cover topics and
indicators concerning how enterprises identify and address adverse impacts
on human rights. Independent verification of human rights reporting can
strengthen its content and credibility. Sector-specific indicators can provide
helpful additional detail.
Remediation
22.	
Where business enterprises identify that they have caused or
contributed to adverse impacts, they should provide for or cooperate in
their remediation through legitimate processes.
Commentary
Even with the best policies and practices, a business enterprise may cause
or contribute to an adverse human rights impact that it has not foreseen or
been able to prevent.
Where a business enterprise identifies such a situation, whether through
its human rights due diligence process or other means, its responsibility to
respect human rights requires active engagement in remediation, by itself or
in cooperation with other actors. Operational-level grievance mechanisms
for those potentially impacted by the business enterprise’s activities can be
one effective means of enabling remediation when they meet certain core
criteria, as set out in Principle 31.
Where adverse impacts have occurred that the business enterprise has not
caused or contributed to, but which are directly linked to its operations,25
products or services by a business relationship, the responsibility to
respect human rights does not require that the enterprise itself provide for
remediation, though it may take a role in doing so.
Some situations, in particular where crimes are alleged, typically will
require cooperation with judicial mechanisms.
Further guidance on mechanisms through which remediation may be
sought, including where allegations of adverse human rights impacts are
contested, is included in chapter III on access to remedy.
Issues of context
23. In all contexts, business enterprises should:
		(a)	
Comply with all applicable laws and respect internationally
recognized human rights, wherever they operate;
		(b)	Seek ways to honour the principles of internationally recognized
human rights when faced with conflicting requirements;
		(c)	Treat the risk of causing or contributing to gross human rights
abuses as a legal compliance issue wherever they operate.
Commentary
Although particular country and local contexts may affect the human rights
risks of an enterprise’s activities and business relationships, all business
enterprises have the same responsibility to respect human rights wherever
they operate. Where the domestic context renders it impossible to meet this
responsibility fully, business enterprises are expected to respect the principles
of internationally recognized human rights to the greatest extent possible in
the circumstances, and to be able to demonstrate their efforts in this regard.
Some operating environments, such as conflict-affected areas, may increase
the risks of enterprises being complicit in gross human rights abuses
committed by other actors (security forces, for example). Business enterprises
should treat this risk as a legal compliance issue, given the expanding
web of potential corporate legal liability arising from extraterritorial civil
claims, and from the incorporation of the provisions of the Rome Statute of
the International Criminal Court in jurisdictions that provide for corporate26
criminal responsibility. In addition, corporate directors, officers and
employees may be subject to individual liability for acts that amount to
gross human rights abuses.
In complex contexts such as these, business enterprises should ensure that
they do not exacerbate the situation. In assessing how best to respond, they
will often be well advised to draw on not only expertise and cross-functional
consultation within the enterprise, but also to consult externally with credible,
independent experts, including from Governments, civil society, national
human rights institutions and relevant multi-stakeholder initiatives.
24.	
Where it is necessary to prioritize actions to address actual and
potential adverse human rights impacts, business enterprises should
first seek to prevent and mitigate those that are most severe or where
delayed response would make them irremediable.
Commentary
While business enterprises should address all their adverse human rights
impacts, it may not always be possible to address them simultaneously. In
the absence of specific legal guidance, if prioritization is necessary business
enterprises should begin with those human rights impacts that would be
most severe, recognizing that a delayed response may affect remediability.
Severity is not an absolute concept in this context, but is relative to the other
human rights impacts the business enterprise has identified.",
