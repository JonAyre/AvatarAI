     "content": "As economies become ever more integrated and the revolution in information and
communications technology continues, the world is getting smaller at the same time
that supply chains are getting more complex. The challenge that employers face to
demonstrate that they respect human rights, to act with due diligence to avoid infringing
the rights of others and to address adverse impacts that occur, has never been clearer.
How to do this in contexts of widespread informality, insufficient law enforcement and
persistent poverty, however, is far from simple. Child labour is a case in point: despite
rapid gains in recent years, there are still 168 million child labourers in the world today,
across all regions and sectors.
The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), adopted
unanimously in 2011 by the UN Human Rights Council, provide a blueprint for employers
to develop robust management systems for due diligence. Crucially, they also address
the government duty to protect individuals from violations of human rights, including
those in which enterprises are involved, and the need for greater access to remedy.
The UNGPs do not create new legal obligations but clarify what existing international
instruments mean for business, and they directly reference the ILO’s 1998 Declaration
on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. ILO Convention No. 138 on Minimum
Age (1973), and ILO Convention No. 182 on Worst Forms of Child Labour (1999) are
among the fundamental principles and rights at work and these Conventions, though
binding only on governments that ratify them, are the relevant child labour standards for
supply chains.
This Child Labour Guidance Tool was created jointly by the ILO and the International
Organisation of Employers (IOE) as a resource for companies to meet the due diligence
requirements laid out in the UNGPs, as they pertain to child labour. It draws on the
long experience of the ILO’s International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour
(ILO-IPEC) in collaborating with employers to combat child labour in supply chains.
Select companies have been closely involved in its development: the contributions
of The Coca-Cola Company, AngloGold Ashanti, Vale, Japan Tobacco and Sterling
Manufacturing have been invaluable. Working in a public-minded and open spirit of
collaboration with the project team, comprised of ILO, IOE and Shift, a non-profit centre
of expertise on the UNGPs, these companies brought insights and experience from
a range of sectors and geographies to ensure that the Guidance Tool is practical and
responsive to the key challenges faced by business.
We are confident that this Guidance Tool will be a source of valuable support for
employers. Our ambition as the IOE, the global voice of business, and the ILO, the
custodian of international labour standards and the UN agency for the world of work,
is that this new resource drives further engagement and collaboration, and adds fresh
impetus to our common goal, the elimination of all forms of child labour.

ILO-IOE CHILD LABOUR GUIDANCE TOOL FOR BUSINESSPART A:
INTRODUCTION:
WHY IS THIS GUIDANCE
TOOL IMPORTANT AND
WHO IS IT FOR?What is the extent of
child labour globally?
Several decades of concerted efforts to combat child labour have led to an impressive
reduction in absolute numbers of child labourers. Nevertheless, as of 2012, there
were still an estimated 168 million child labourers, including over 85 million children
in hazardous work – one of the worst forms of child labour that pose the greatest
risks to children’s mental and physical health. Worldwide, approximately one in every
10 children is involved in child labour, and in Sub-Saharan Africa it is one in five.1 Children
work in fields and on farms, in factories, as domestic workers, or in informal businesses
such as artisanal mining, as street vendors and trash pickers; they can be caught in
commercial sexual exploitation, or forced to engage in armed conflict or drug trafficking.
Child labour thus remains a pressing and
large-scale problem. The ILO’s International
Programme on the Elimination of Child
Labour (ILO-IPEC) calls on all actors,
including business enterprises, to meet
their obligations to ensure the progressive
elimination of all forms of child labour
worldwide. This Guidance Tool forms part of
that broader effort.

Defining Child Labour
Child labour is work that deprives
children of their childhood, their
potential and their dignity, and that
is harmful to their physical or mental
development including by interfering
with their education.
For more detail on defining child labour, see

ILO-IOE CHILD LABOUR GUIDANCE TOOL FOR BUSINESSHow could my business be
involved with child labour?
As a starting point, all businesses, of whatever size, need to ensure that children are not
working in their own facilities or operations. The ILO and IOE have produced practical
guidance for employers3 that explains how to identify child labour and prevent it in the
employers’ own business. This Guidance Tool focuses on the three “H’s”:
¡¡ Hiring: end the practice of hiring children;
¡¡ Hours: reduce the working hours of any children above the minimum age to ensure
that they do not work more than the number of hours allowed under national law for
light work and regular work.

More information:
Section B.2 list the definitions of these three “H’s” terms.
For many large and multinational companies, the risk of child labour in their own facilities
may not be significant. However, child labour impacts, especially the worst forms of child
labour, are often found throughout the supply chain, in the practices of subcontractors,
or in local communities neighbouring certain types of company operations. While
companies may not always have contractual or commercial relationships with the
entities that are causing child labour impacts, the impacts may be linked to a company’s
operations, products or services through a business relationship. For such companies,
this type of “linkage” situation will be the leading source of child labour risks.
Examples of Companies That Could Be Involved With Child
Labour Impacts
üü Companies sourcing agricultural products including cocoa, coffee, tea, sugar,
tobacco, spices, nuts, seafood, seeds, forestry products, and meat.
üü Apparel companies or companies sourcing clothing, shoes or accessories.
üü Electronics companies with manufacturing supply chains.
üü Companies sourcing metals, minerals or gems, either directly or through suppliers.
üü Companies that make or sell products with valuable packaging that children may be
involved in scavenging and selling.
üü Companies offering or relying on tourism or transportation services.
üü Companies operating in or sourcing from areas of current or recent conflict.
üü Companies operating in or sourcing from countries with large informal sectors.

3Why are expectations of business
growing?
Awareness of the problem of child labour in global value chains has grown in recent
years, due to important work by the ILO, governments, social partners, civil society
organizations, and the media. This has led to increased pressure on business to prevent
and address such impacts, including by investors, trade unions, NGOs and consumers.
But perhaps the most significant development is the clarification of the responsibility of all
companies to respect human rights in their own operations and throughout their business
relationships, as set out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights4 (UNGPs). The UNGPs were unanimously endorsed by States in the UN Human
Rights Council in 2011 and since then have helped to drive global convergence regarding
the expectations of business.

More information:
Section B.1 discuss in more detail the UNGPs.
How is this Guidance Tool
different from previous ILO-IOE
guidance for employers?
This Guidance Tool is grounded in the UNGPs and it builds on the ILO-IOE 2007 guides
for employers5 by bringing the lens of the UNGPs to bear on what all companies, both
national and multinational, are expected to do to meet the global expectation that they
respect human rights throughout their operations, including in their value chains. It
explores what is expected of companies when seeking to prevent and address impacts
deep in the supply chain, including working together with other actors, particularly
governments. This Guidance Tool refers to the relevant international standards of the
ILO, and reflects the experiences of individual companies that are working to implement
the UNGPs.
Because this Guidance Tool focuses on the implications of the UNGPs for company
efforts to prevent and address child labour, the ILO and IOE worked together with Shift
to develop it. Shift is a non-profit organization chaired by Professor John Ruggie, the

ILO-IOE: Eliminating child labour (2007), op.cit.
ILO-IOE CHILD LABOUR GUIDANCE TOOL FOR BUSINESSauthor of the UNGPs, and the Shift team was centrally involved in helping to shape and
draft the UNGPs.
The Guidance Tool was developed with input from companies and other members of
the Child Labour Platform6 of the ILO and UN Global Compact. It references existing
reports, tools and materials on child labour wherever they add particular value.
This Guidance Tool builds on existing ILO and IOE guidance. As noted above, the 2007
ILO‑IOE guides for employers set out the actions that all companies should take to
eliminate and remediate child labour in their own operations.
By focusing on the UNGPs and their expectations about the actions companies should
take where they are connected to child labour impacts through their value chains, this
guidance should be particularly useful for large or multinational companies with extended
global value chains. It should also be useful for small and medium-sized companies that
sit within such value chains and are seeking to strengthen their own efforts against child
labour, for example to attract or reassure business partners. It should also be useful for
companies at risk of being involved with child labour impacts in communities that may
be affected by their operations (particularly in the extractive and agricultural sectors) or
through their financing or investment decisions.
This Guidance Tool aims to support companies with different degrees of involvement in,
knowledge about and capacity for managing child labour risks.

Who is this Guidance Tool for?
5This Guidance Tool should also be useful to stakeholders other than companies who are
interested in supporting, incentivising or requiring companies to prevent and address
child labour impacts in their operations. These stakeholders may include investors,
trade unions, civil society organizations and governments.
How Was This Guidance TOOL Developed?
üü Desktop research to review existing sources of guidance.
üü Development of a diagnostic protocol based on the UNGPs.
üü In-depth assessments of the efforts of five companies in different sectors to prevent
and address child labour.
üü Multistakeholder workshops hosted by the ILO and IOE.
üü Bilateral conversations with companies to source further examples.
üü Feedback from expert stakeholders on drafts.
Can this Guidance Tool help
me make the business case to
colleagues?
Preventing and addressing harm to children is a compelling human rights issue that
many companies do not need to be persuaded to commit to. What many companies
do need help with is understanding what action to take (beyond having a policy), how
to assess the effectiveness of existing company approaches, and how to change
approaches that are not working.
However, in the face of competing priorities and limited resources, internal champions
may need additional arguments. Points that some champions within companies have
found helpful include:
¡¡ Improved risk management: involvement with child labour can expose a company
to public criticism and campaigning by civil society organizations and in the press,
leading to reputational harm and harm to employee retention and recruitment;
¡¡ Impacts on markets: child labour hampers the economic development of a country
and the income of consumers that are needed for long-term business success;
¡¡ Greater access to business opportunities: business customers increasingly
recognise the reduced risk to themselves when working with a company that
effectively manages its human rights risks, especially as government procurement
requirements integrate human rights considerations with greater frequency;
¡¡ Positive recognition: investors are increasingly concerned about human rights
issues and also willing to acknowledge company efforts to address challenges;

forced and child labour, from companies seeking federal contracts.7

THE UN GUIDING PRINCIPLES
ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN
RIGHTS:
WHAT ARE COMPANIES
EXPECTED TO DO ABOUT
CHILD LABOUR?B.1 The implications of the
UN Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights
What are the UN Guiding Principles on Business
and Human Rights?
The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) were unanimously
endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in June 2011, supported by governments
from all regions of the world. They were authored by Professor John Ruggie, the former
Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Business and Human Rights.
A critical contribution of the UNGPs has been to set out clearly the duties of States and
the responsibilities of companies to ensure that businesses operate with respect for
human rights. The UNGPs are founded on three pillars:
¡¡ The State duty to protect human rights against abuse by third parties, including
business, through appropriate policies, legislation, regulations and adjudication.
¡¡ The corporate responsibility to respect human rights, meaning to act with due
diligence to avoid infringing on the rights of others and to address negative impacts
with which they are involved.
¡¡ The need for greater access to effective remedy, both judicial and non-judicial,
for victims of business-related human rights abuse.
The UNGPs complement the ILO MNE Declaration,8 adopted in 1977. Since their
endorsement, the UNGPs have driven a convergence in international frameworks
and commitments on business and human rights, reinforcing the UNGPs’ position as
the authoritative global framework on the expectations of business when it comes to
respecting human rights. The UNGPs are reflected in frameworks such as the OECD
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the ISO 26000 standard on social responsibility,
the IFC Performance Standards, the UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles and a growing
number of commitments by various industry and multistakeholder initiatives.

empent/Publications/WCMS_094386/lang--en/index.htm.
ILO-IOE CHILD LABOUR GUIDANCE TOOL FOR BUSINESSThe expectations of business set out in the UNGPs apply to all internationally recognised
human rights. At a minimum, this includes:
¡¡ The International Bill of Human Rights,9 comprising:
yy The 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights;
yy The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;
yy The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;
¡¡ The ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.10
The UNGPs clarify that companies should also pay attention to additional standards
addressing the human rights of individuals or groups that may be particularly vulnerable
to negative impacts, which clearly includes children.11
States have established duties under international law to respect, protect and fulfil
internationally recognised human rights, including the right to be free from child labour.
The UNGPs do not create any new obligations for States; rather, they reinforce the need
for States to consider whether national law and policy effectively protect against business
involvement in child labour, and if not, where law and policy could be strengthened
either in content or enforcement.
There are various essential roles for the State to play in setting the groundwork for the
elimination and remediation of child labour. This includes ensuring that:
¡¡ National laws are in line with ILO Conventions regarding minimum age, hazardous
work and broader protections for children and are effectively enforced in relation to
both domestic and foreign companies.
¡¡ There is an effective system of labour inspections that includes identifying and
remedying instances of child labour.
¡¡ Necessary wage measures, social protection and support for employment creation,
formalising the informal economy, and other measures to combat household poverty
are in place.
¡¡ National policies and programmes of action to eliminate child labour are in place,
including appropriate education and training as alternatives to child labour.
¡¡ Schools are within reasonable travelling distance for their intended students, are
free of cost to children and their families, and are of sufficient quality (often a local or
provincial government responsibility).

11¡¡ Where child labour is systemic in certain sectors or communities, that there are

including by bridging education or vocational training for older children.
¡¡ Where child labour occurs, it is appropriately remediated, taking full account of the
best interests of the children involved.
What do the UNGPs mean for companies
at risk of being involved with child labour?
The UNGPs clarify the steps companies need to take to meet the expectation that they
should respect the right to be free from child labour, including in their own operations
and in their business relationships. To meet this responsibility, companies that are at risk
of being involved in child labour impacts need to put in place:
¡¡ an appropriate policy commitment that is embedded throughout the business;
¡¡ human rights due diligence processes to identify, prevent, manage and account for
child labour impacts occurring in their own operations or their value chain;
¡¡ remediation processes to provide remedy if the company has caused a negative
impact, and/or contribute to providing remedy, if it has contributed to a negative
impact, to the extent of its contribution.

More information:
Section B.3 explains in detail what is expected of companies
under the UNGPs.
Part C provides specific steps and suggestions for how companies
can meet this responsibility in relation to child labour.
What if the State is not fulfilling its duty to protect?
Failure by the State to meet its duty to protect does undeniably make it harder for
companies to meet their responsibility to respect as set out in the UNGPs. However,
such failure is not an excuse for company inaction. For example, while it is the State’s
responsibility to put in place an effective labour inspection system, companies also need
to have their own policies and processes in place to verify workers’ ages in a manner
that respects workers’ dignity.
The UNGPs expect companies to comply with national law, even if it is not enforced.
Where national law conflicts with international standards on child labour, the UNGPs
expect companies to seek ways to honour the principles of the relevant international
standards.
12
ILO-IOE CHILD LABOUR GUIDANCE TOOL FOR BUSINESSMany companies have found that without meaningful State involvement at the local,
regional and national levels, combating child labour effectively is difficult, if not impossible.
As part of meeting their responsibility to respect, companies will often want to find ways
to engage with States to discuss the State’s critical role in protecting children. In doing
so, it can be particularly helpful to engage through national employers’ organizations.12

More information:
Section B.3 and Part C discuss on the process of engaging
with governments to mitigate child labour risks.
Employers’ and workers’ organizations, civil society organizations, international
organizations and other stakeholders can all play constructive roles to contribute to the
elimination of child labour. Companies often engage or partner with these actors as part
of efforts to prevent and address child labour impacts.
In particular, employers’ organizations can contribute to the development of national
policies against child labour, lobby for the effective elimination of child labour, and can
provide advice to their members about legislation related to child labour. Employers’
organizations can also advise their members about hiring policies of suppliers,
particularly suppliers in the informal economy. In addition, employers’ organizations can
participate in collective action to eliminate child labour amongst their members in a
country, region, or sector.
Trade unions play an important role as watchdogs and can take direct action to prevent
child labour and remove child labourers from the workplace. For example, trade unions
can provide training and promote safe and healthy working conditions that can help
reduce risks to working children above the minimum age as well as adult workers.
They can also contribute to policy development and lobby at the national level. Trade
unions are also one of the three parties in tripartite discussions to establish and update
hazardous work lists at the national level.
National and international civil society organizations focusing on child labour and
children’s right more broadly can also play a variety of roles. For example, civil society
organizations can perform a watchdog role regarding the activities of companies and
the State, conduct field based research on child labour, be part of multistakeholder
initiatives, engage companies to become more active in tackling child labour, or work at
the community level to support programmes to combat child labour.

WHAT ARE COMPANIES EXPECTED TO DO ABOUT CHILD LABOUR?
What roles do other stakeholders have in
preventing and addressing child labour?
13B.2 Understanding child labour
impacts
What is a child labour impact?
In general, child labour is work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential
and their dignity, and that is harmful to their physical or mental development including
by interfering with their education. Specifically, it means types of work that are not
permitted for children below the relevant minimum age.
Children have an internationally recognised right to be free from child labour. A child
labour impact refers to an actual or potential infringement (i.e., a limitation on or
undermining) of the right to be free from child labour.
When is work performed by a child
“child labour”?
A child is a person under the age of 18. Not all work performed by children is child
labour. Millions of young people above the relevant minimum age undertake work,
paid or unpaid, that is lawful, appropriate for their age and maturity and part of their
socialisation and school to work transition. By working, these young people learn to
take responsibility, gain skills, add to their family’s or their own income and wellbeing,
and contribute to their country’s economy.
Child labour encompasses all unacceptable forms of work performed by children. It is
work that exposes children to harm or abuse because: 1) it is likely to impede the child’s
education and full development (due to the child’s age); and/or 2) it jeopardises the
physical, mental or moral wellbeing of a child (due to the nature of the work).
The following terms are important to understand when child work becomes child labour:
¡¡ Light work: This is work that children can do as long as it does not threaten their
health and safety, or hinder their education or vocational training (generally, non-
hazardous work for fewer than 14 hours per week). It should only be performed by
children aged 13 or over (or, provisionally, age 12 in certain developing countries)
when permitted by local law.
¡¡ Basic minimum age: The minimum age for work should not be below the age
for finishing compulsory schooling, and in all cases not lower than 15 years of age
(or, provisionally, age 14 in certain developing countries). Some countries set the
minimum age at 16.
14
ILO-IOE CHILD LABOUR GUIDANCE TOOL FOR BUSINESS¡¡ Hazardous work: One of the worst forms of child labour, this is work that is inherently
dangerous, such as working with pesticides or underground, or carried out under
conditions that are particularly risky for children, such as work for excessively long
hours or in high temperatures. It should not be performed by people under 18.
States may create limited exceptions for children over 16, in dialogue with national
employers’ and workers’ organizations, where the health, safety and morals of the
children involved are fully protected and they have received specific instruction on
the relevant activity.
¡¡ Other worst forms of child labour: These comprise slavery, trafficking, debt
bondage and other forms of forced labour, including forced recruitment for use
in armed conflict, the use of children in prostitution and pornography, and in illicit
activities such as organised begging or the trafficking or sale of narcotics. Children
should never be involved in such activities.

More information:
Figure 1 summarises the implications of these terms.
Annex provides definitions of key international standards
and instruments that are relevant to child labour.
15How are child labour categories defined at the
national level?
ILO Conventions allow certain flexibility in setting minimum ages and determining what
constitutes hazardous work. The basic minimum age is often set at 15, but a number
of countries set it higher. Brazil, China and Kenya, for example, are among 35 countries
that currently set it at 16. As noted above, developing countries may, provisionally, set
a minimum age of 14 (some 47 have done so) or apply exemptions for a set period of
time to particular types of work (though in practice few have done this).
National governments define what is considered hazardous work through a tripartite
process with employers’ and workers’ organizations and list the activities in “hazardous
work lists”. Companies may adopt policies that are more restrictive than these lists, but
policies should never be more permissive than them.
What are the causes of child labour and
what contextual factors heighten the likelihood
of child labour impacts occurring?
Child labour is often present where the enforcement of laws against child labour is
limited, where social protection for children and families is lacking, particularly free,
quality education, where poverty is endemic, and where the rule of law is poor. In
addition, there are a range of contextual factors that contribute to heightened risk of
child labour impacts. Within contexts where child labour occurs, there are both “push”
and “pull” factors leading to a child being more likely to become a child labourer.
The following table builds on a more extensive discussion of the causes of child labour in
ILO-IOE guides for employers.13 It includes general contextual factors that heighten the
overall risk of child labour impacts, as well as specific push and pull factors.

17B.3 The corporate responsibility
to respect children’s right to
be free from child labour
How can my company meet its responsibility to
respect?
Companies should have the following elements of a management system in place to
help prevent and address negative impacts, including child labour impacts.
ELEMENTS OF THE RESPONSIBILITY TO RESPECT
A policy commitment that is embedded throughout the organization.
Human rights due diligence processes, which involve:
üü assessing impacts, including risks of child labour;
üü integrating the results into actions and decisions;
üü tracking performance;
üü being prepared to communicate about performance.
Remediation processes, including operational-level grievance mechanisms.
These elements may be part of a stand-alone system for managing human rights risks,
or they may be integrated into other existing company systems. In all cases, these
elements must focus on risk to people (in this case, risk to children) rather than risk to
the business alone.
There is no “one size fits all” approach, and implementation will depend on a company’s
size, countries of operation, ownership, structure and nature of its business. It will also
depend on whether or not child labour is a “salient human rights issue” for the company,
which is discussed below.
18
ILO-IOE CHILD LABOUR GUIDANCE TOOL FOR BUSINESSHow do we determine whether child labour is a
“salient human rights issue” for our company?
Salient human rights issues are those human rights that are at risk of the most severe
negative impacts through a company’s activities or business relationships. The severity
of an impact in the UNGPs, and in this Guidance Tool, is evaluated using three factors:
¡¡ Scale: gravity of the impact on affected people.
¡¡ Scope: the number of people affected.
¡¡ Remediability: any limits on the ability to restore affected people to a situation at
least the same as, or equivalent to, their situation before the impact.
These three factors can be summarised as: how serious is the harm; how widespread
is the harm; and if the harm occurs, can it be put right?
Child labour will often involve grave harm to children that can be challenging to remediate.
In considering how widespread the impact may be, and its likelihood, companies will
want to consider whether they, for example:
¡¡ Source agricultural products of which the cultivation is known to involve severe child
labour impacts (e.g., cocoa, seeds, sugarcane, tobacco, cotton, hazelnuts, vanilla).
¡¡ Operate in countries or areas with a high prevalence of child labour across various
industries.
¡¡ Operate in countries that have many of the contextual “push” or “pull” factors that
increase the risk of or perpetuate child labour (e.g., a large informal economy),
discussed above.
PART B: THE UN GUIDING PRINCIPLES ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS:
WHAT ARE COMPANIES EXPECTED TO DO ABOUT CHILD LABOUR?
Where one, or a combination, of these factors exists, the impact may be severe. Where
the likelihood of an impact occurring is also high, the salience of the issue increases.
However, because salience focuses on the severity of the harm to people, impacts of
high severity and low likelihood should still be prioritised for attention.
19What are the different ways in which my
company may be involved in child labour
impacts?
There are three ways in which companies can be involved in child labour impacts under
the UNGPs:
DESCRIPTIONEXAMPLES
A company may cause a child
labour impact through its own
actions or decisions.Employing children below the minimum age
provided for in ILO Convention No. 138.
A company may contribute to
a child labour impact through a
business relationship (e.g., with a
supplier, customer or government)
or through its own actions in
tandem with other parties’ actions.Repeatedly changing product requirements for
suppliers without adjusting production deadlines
or prices, thus incentivising them to engage
subcontractors who rely on child labour.
A company neither causes nor
contributes to a child labour
impact, but the impact is linked to
its operations, products or services
because it is caused by an entity
with which the company has a
business relationship.Embroidery on a retail company’s clothing
products that is subcontracted by a supplier
to child labourers in homes, in violation of
contractual obligations and not incentivised by
the retail company.
Exposing children under 18 to hazardous working
conditions.
Contributing to the cumulative pollution of a river,
negatively affecting local farmers’ livelihoods,
leading them to send their children to work to
compensate for loss of income.
Procuring raw materials or commodities produced
with child labour on the spot (cash) market or
through an agent.

Part C explains in more detail the distinctions between these
forms of involvement, especially contribution and linkage.
20
ILO-IOE CHILD LABOUR GUIDANCE TOOL FOR BUSINESSWhat action are companies expected to take
and when?
Where a company causes or contributes to child labour through its own activities, it
is expected to stop doing so, and remediate the harm or its contribution to the harm.
Where child labour is linked to the company’s operations, products or services by
a business relationship, the company is expected to take action to seek to mitigate
the risk of the impact continuing or recurring. Under the UNGPs, the company is not
expected to provide a remedy for the impact, though some may choose to do so.

Efforts to seek to mitigate child labour risks that are directly linked to a company’s
operations may involve the company contributing to broader efforts to prevent and
address child labour, which can include remediation programmes. To be clear, where
the UNGPs talk about providing “remedy”, what is meant is a specific remedy for the
specific harm experienced by a specific individual.
PART B: THE UN GUIDING PRINCIPLES ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS:
WHAT ARE COMPANIES EXPECTED TO DO ABOUT CHILD LABOUR?
IF A COMPANY…
21What is leverage and how can my company
build and apply it?
Leverage is a central concept in the UNGPs. Using leverage is critical to prevent and
address child labour in business relationships throughout the value chain.
A company may perceive its leverage over a third
party that is causing or contributing to an impact to
be limited because, for example, it does not have a
contractual relationship with the entity, or there are
other challenges with expecting a business partner
to change its practices. However, experience shows
that companies often have more leverage on these
issues than they realise, and that they can increase
leverage where it is lacking, including through
collaboration with others.
Leverage is the ability of
a business enterprise to
affect change in the wrongful
practices of another party that
is causing or contributing to a
child labour impact.
Key forms of leverage include:14
¡¡ Traditional commercial leverage: leverage that sits within the activities that the
company routinely undertakes in commercial relationships, such as contracting;
¡¡ Broader business leverage: leverage that a company can exercise on its own but
through activities that are not routine or typical in commercial relationships, such as
capacity building, including awareness raising and using “moral persuasion”;
¡¡ Leverage together with business peers: leverage created through collective
action with other companies within one or several industries;
¡¡ Leverage through bilateral engagement: leverage generated through engaging
one-on-one with one or more other actors, such as governments, business peers,
trade unions, international organizations or civil society organizations;
¡¡ Leverage through multistakeholder collaboration: leverage generated through
collaborative action with governments, business peers, trade unions, international
organizations and/or civil society organizations.

22
ILO-IOE CHILD LABOUR GUIDANCE TOOL FOR BUSINESSIs my company expected to support as well as
respect children’s rights?
As explained in Section B.1, respecting human rights, including the right to be free from
child labour, is a baseline standard that all companies are expected to meet.
A growing number of companies choose to contribute to the broader promotion of human
rights, including children’s rights. The ILO MNE Declaration15 aims to, “encourage the
positive contribution which multinational enterprises can make to economic and social
progress” and calls on companies to “contribute to the realization of the ILO Declaration
on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work,” which includes child labour.
In addition, companies that commit to the UN Global Compact undertake to support
as well as respect human rights, including children’s rights. The Children’s Rights and
Business Principles,16 developed by UNICEF, the UN Global Compact and Save the
Children, encourage companies to support children’s rights in a variety of ways.
Failing to take meaningful action to prevent and address child labour in the company’s
operations or value chain cannot be offset by doing good elsewhere. However, there
are often much closer connections between a company’s efforts to prevent and address
systemic human rights risks, like child labour in the supply chain, and its efforts to
support human rights – including children’s rights – than the company itself may realise.

PREVENTING AND
ADDRESSING
CHILD LABOUR IMPACTS:
PRACTICAL STEPS FOR
COMPANIES TO TAKEDevelop a policy
commitment and embed it
throughout the organization
What is expected?
Every company is expected to make a public commitment to respect internationally
recognised human rights, which include the right to be free from child labour. Not all
companies are expected to have a stand alone policy on child labour. Whatever approach
a company chooses, it should reflect its potential involvement with child labour risks. For
instance, a company in an industry with significant and widespread child labour risks may
choose to develop a separate child labour statement. Regardless of what form it takes,
the commitment should be embedded throughout the organization, which means driving
respect for human rights across the organization and into its business values and culture.
What are the key steps?
C.1.1 Content and applicability: A specific commitment on child labour needs to take
into account relevant international standards (see Annex A). It also needs to clearly state the
company’s expectations of its own staff and business partners.
üü Does the company have a public commitment to respect human rights,
including children’s right to be free from child labour?
üü Does the commitment reference the International Bill of Human Rights
and/or the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at
Work? Does it reference the UNGPs?
Diagnostic
Questions
üü Does it reference relevant standards relating to children’s rights, such as
the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child and ILO Convention No. 138
on minimum age for admission to employment and ILO Convention
No. 182 on the worst forms of child labour?
üü Does it permit safe work for children above the minimum age, if such
work exists?
üü Does the commitment make clear the company’s expectations of
personnel, business partners and other parties directly linked to its
operations, products or services?
26
ILO-IOE CHILD LABOUR GUIDANCE TOOL FOR BUSINESSüü Is the statement informed by relevant internal and/or external expertise?
Diagnostic
Questions
üü Has the statement been approved at the most senior level of the
company?
üü Have the perspectives of relevant business partners, including suppliers,
been considered in its development?
üü Have other stakeholders been involved? How?
C.1.3 Dissemination: The company needs to consider how to best communicate its
commitment to those who need to be part of its implementation (e.g., staff, contractors,
suppliers), and those who have a direct interest in its implementation (e.g., potentially
affected children and their families, local communities).
Diagnostic
Questions
üü Is the commitment publicly available, and communicated internally and
externally to all personnel, business partners, and other relevant parties?
üü Is it available in relevant languages, and is it communicated in a manner
that takes into account different needs of various audiences?
C.1.4 Internal alignment: The company should consider and address any tensions
between the commitment and other operational policies, procedures and guidance. It
should also allocate appropriate accountability for the commitment’s implementation.
Diagnostic
Questions
üü Are relevant operational policies and procedures aligned with the
commitment, and if there are any tensions between them, are they
addressed?
üü Is there appropriate internal accountability for implementation of the
commitment?
üü Is there demonstrated leadership from the top of the organization on the
issues raised in the policy or statement?
C.1.5 Application to business relationships: Business partners should be made aware
of the company’s policy commitment and be appropriately supported, incentivised or
required to align with its contents.
Diagnostic
Questions
üü How is the policy or statement embedded in the terms of business
relationships (e.g., with suppliers, joint venture partners, customers)?
PART C: PREVENTING AND ADDRESSING CHILD LABOUR IMPACTS: PRACTICAL STEPS FOR COMPANIES TO TAKE
C.1.2 Development and approval: Development of the policy commitment should
involve staff in key internal functions, such as procurement and human resources, as well as
relevant children’s and wider labour rights expertise from inside and outside the company.
It can also be helpful to test the statement with relevant business partners to whom it will
apply and with representatives of directly affected stakeholders. The involvement of senior
leadership in approving the commitment helps signal its importance.

ILO-IOE CHILD LABOUR GUIDANCE TOOL FOR BUSINESSHard question No. 1
??
The challenge
Companies need to comply with the laws of the countries in which they operate. However,
the UNGPs clarify that companies are expected to seek to honour the principles underlying
international human rights standards where domestic laws fall below or directly conflict with
those standards.
Gaps that frequently occur in domestic laws include:17
¡¡ The minimum age for entry into work is
below the compulsory school age;
¡¡ There is a gap between the age at which a
young person is allowed to leave school and
the minimum age to enter work;
¡¡ Certain types of light or hazardous work
are permitted at ages below those set in
relevant ILO Conventions;
¡¡ No national hazardous work list has been
adopted, or existing lists do not include
forms of work that ILO Conventions and
ILO Recommendation No. 190 consider
hazardous, or are very general or unclear;
COMPANY PRACTICE No. 1
Country-specific information
One company worked together with
ILO-IPEC to develop country-specific
reports on national legislation and
other responses to hazardous work by
children for each country in which it has
operations. The reports were used to
support country-level implementation
of the company’s global child labour
commitments.
¡¡ Certain sectors (e.g., agriculture) or types of
work (e.g., domestic work) are exempt from
minimum age laws, contrary to ILO Conventions.
Practical approaches by companies
A critical first step for many companies has been to conduct a thorough analysis of child
labour standards with regard to minimum age and hazardous work lists in each country
where the company operates or sources from, in order to understand where it is likely to
face challenges.
The ILO has a publicly accessible database of national child labour legislation and relevant
policies (for example, laws on compulsory education) called the Countries Dashboard. This
database also includes assessments of the application of ILO Conventions on child labour.
Some companies have used these databases to carry out a detailed analysis in each of their
countries of operation. Based on that analysis, they have developed their own evaluation of

29potentially hazardous work in line with ILO standards. Some of these companies have also
engaged with governments to request clarification or updates about existing hazardous
work lists (see Company practice No. 2 box).
In addition, some multinational companies have signed International Framework
Agreements (or Global Framework Agreements) with global trade union federations
through which they commit to respect the same labour rights standards in all the countries
where the company operates, including with respect to child labour.

ILO-IOE CHILD LABOUR GUIDANCE TOOL FOR BUSINESSCOMPANY PRACTICE No. 2
One of the industries with a high prevalence of child labour is tobacco. Children in tobacco
growing communities that supply large international tobacco companies (either directly
or through agents) are often involved in child labour, including in extremely hazardous
conditions. The Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco Growing (ECLT) Foundation brings
together companies (growers, buyers and manufacturers), farmers’ representatives, civil
society organizations, international organizations, and others with the aim of ending child
labour in tobacco growing communities.
In late 2014, companies participating in ECLT adopted a Members’ Pledge of Commitment
to step up action in support of the Foundation’s goals. The pledge references ILO
Conventions Nos. 138 and 182 regarding child labour and the UNGPs. Tobacco buying and
manufacturing companies commit to the following actions throughout their “entire tobacco-
sourcing supply chains”:
üü make an appropriate policy commitment to eliminate child labour;
üü implement due diligence, consistent with the size and circumstances of the company,
with the aim of identifying, preventing, mitigating and accounting for their adverse
impacts on child labour;
üü provide for or cooperate in legitimate processes of remediation;
üü help build the capacity of farmers and farmer organizations.
All members commit to work collaboratively with:
üü workers’ organizations and cooperatives to promote the pledge’s requirements;
üü a wide range of stakeholders, including but not limited to, workers’ organizations, civil
society, educational institutions, local communities, and children, to advocate against
child labour and support the pledge;

Tobacco companies’ pledge
31Assess child labour
impacts
What is expected?
To manage child labour impacts, a company first needs to know what those impacts are
or could be. The company will likely already have conducted some analysis of its human
rights risks in order to determine its salient human rights issues. Devising effective child
labour prevention and mitigation measures is likely to require a more detailed assessment.
Assessments may be stand alone or integrated into broader processes, provided that they
maintain a focus on risk to people, rather than risk to the business alone. Assessment should
be an ongoing activity as risks change over time.
What are the key steps?
C.2.1 Systematic assessment processes: Impact assessment processes should
identify where and how children may be at risk of child labour through the company’s own
operations or business relationships.
Diagnostic
Questions
üü Does the company systematically identify and assess actual or potential
child labour impacts with which it may be involved?
üü Does it consider its business relationships as well as its own operations?
üü Does it take account of risks arising from particular operating contexts?
C.2.2 Prioritisation: When legitimate resource constraints mean that it is necessary
to prioritise certain business activities or value chain relationships for more detailed
assessments, a company should do so on a principled basis in line with the UNGPs
(see also Hard question No. 2).
Diagnostic
Questions
üü Where the company prioritises certain activities or relationships for
assessment, does it do so on the basis that the actual or potential
impacts may be particularly severe (in their scale, scope or the extent to
which they can be remediated)?
C.2.3 Expertise and stakeholder engagement: When assessing impacts, companies
should engage relevant staff internally (e.g., procurement staff for impacts in the
supply chain, community relations staff for child labour in the local community), as
well as drawing on external expertise as needed. To fully understand the impacts in
question, a company should also engage with potentially affected stakeholders or their
representatives, or with credible proxies for their views where direct engagement is not
feasible. This topic is discussed further below.

and external expertise?
33Hard question No. 2
??
Can I prioritise areas of my supply chain for attention
when I know there are multiple child labour impacts
taking place?
The challenge
In line with the UNGPs, companies need to consider how they may be involved with
child labour impacts across their value chains. However, for companies with hundreds or
thousands of suppliers (or other business partners), this can be a daunting proposition.
Naturally, a company in that position will focus its attention on certain areas. Currently,
companies tend to focus on the basis of where they have the greatest control, or where the
risk is greatest to the business. However, the UNGPs establish a different, and principled,
basis for such prioritisation when it is necessary. Under the UNGPs, when companies need
to prioritise suppliers or other business relationships for attention, they should do so based
on the severity of the child labour (and other human rights) impacts involved.
Practical approaches by companies
Some companies have “mapped” how they may be involved in child labour
impacts: This involves identifying the various entities in their value chain, or in the value
chains of specific commodities, that could
be involved in child labour impacts, their REMINDER
(rough) number, and how the company is The severity of a child labour impact is
connected to them.
determined by its:
The example below provides one illustration
of this from the perspective of brand and
retail companies that use sugar in their
products. In relation to sugarcane, most
child labour impacts are likely to occur at
the small-holder or plantation level. In other
commodity supply chains, impacts may
be prevalent at other stages, all the way
through to end use.
üü Scale: how grave is the impact (e.g., is it
a worst form of child labour)?
üü Scope: what is the number of children
affected.
üü Remediability: can the affected children
be restored to the situation they were in
before they were harmed?
Test the mapping with expert stakeholders: This can help the company to develop or
refine the analysis, including thinking through appropriate prioritisation. It can also equip
stakeholders to play a role in later parts of the due diligence process, where the company
is seeking to take action or evaluate whether it has been effective.

COMPANY PRACTICE No. 3
Value chain mapping across the business
A food and beverage company conducted an extensive value chain mapping to systematically
prioritise human rights risks (including child labour) across its operations. The process has
been refined with each management cycle.
The value chain is mapped in five parts: raw materials, production, distribution, marketing
and recycling. The company analyses the specific stakeholders that could be affected,
including employees, contract workers, workers in the supply chain (first tier and beyond),
local communities and vulnerable groups, and which human rights could be impacted, with
input from internal and external experts (including on child labour).
The mapping revealed that child labour risks were present across the value chain but differed
in nature. For example, child labour in raw materials sourcing is likely to involve family
farms, whereas for recycling child labour typically relates to scavenging. The company then
mapped specific high risk commodities to identify the number of entities in the value chain
and its leverage with them in order to develop a strategy to address identified risks.

The company may feel pushed to focus on

pressure from various sources. Yet these may
not be, or may not include, the places where
the most sever impacts on people are
occurring. One of the most effective
approaches can be to involve stakeholders in
the company’s analysis to benefit from their
views, as well as build their understanding of
the company’s focus on risk to people.
In addition to considering the scope of the
impact (with the most grave being the worst
forms of child labour), companies also need
to consider the scale (number of children
affected) and remediability (any limits on
whether the impacts can be remediated)
when prioritising. The company may also be

What is expected?
Once companies have identified how they may be involved with child labour impacts, and
have prioritised certain impacts for attention where that is necessary, they need to put
effective prevention and mitigation measures in place. Where impacts are occurring in the
value chain, leverage will play a key role. Leverage means a company’s ability to affect
change in the behaviour of a third party that is causing or contributing to child labour
impacts, or that needs to be part of the solution in order to prevent child labour impacts
from continuing or recurring.
As stated previously, gaps in governance such as a lack of quality education, inadequate
enforcement of child labour laws and weak rule of law are often central causes of child labour.
Therefore, government action is critical for the success of sustainable efforts to prevent and
address such impacts. Companies cannot replace governments in fulfilling these essential
duties of the State. Effective engagement and collaboration with governments will therefore
often be key to company efforts to take action on child labour impacts.

PART C: PREVENTING AND ADDRESSING CHILD LABOUR IMPACTS: PRACTICAL STEPS FOR COMPANIES TO TAKE
Diagnostic
Questions
39Hard question No. 3
??
How might my company contribute through our own actions
or decisions to child labour impacts caused by a third party?
The challenge
The UNGPs clarify that companies can contribute to
child labour impacts either in tandem with other actors,
or by facilitating or incentivising a third party to cause or
contribute to an impact. Understanding how a company’s
own actions or decisions may facilitate or incentivise
negative impacts by business partners or others with
whom it has a business relationship involves going beyond
the contractual terms of the relationship to understand
how the relationship is conducted in practice.
Companies can cause or
contribute to child labour
impacts, or their operations,
products or services may
be linked to child labour
impacts (see Section B.3).
This hard question deals
with contribution.
In a typical example, a company has a clear supplier policy in place that prohibits child
labour. However, the company makes repeat changes to its order specifications to its
supplier, without adjustments to price or delivery time. The company is unaware of the
impact these changes have on the supplier’s ability to adhere to the company’s policy.
A supplier may depend on a particular company’s business for various reasons:
¡¡ Small-holder farmers (e.g., of sugarcane, tobacco, cocoa or seeds) often produce for
a single buyer, or may have a direct contract with a large multinational company. Even
where small-holders are contractually able to sell to another company, they may incur
heavy penalties or face other practical barriers to doing so.
¡¡ Suppliers in low cost/high volume production (e.g., apparel) often face fierce competition
from factories in the same industrial zone, region, country or even from neighbouring
countries. This competition gives buying companies significant leverage over a particular
supplier.
¡¡ Even where a buying company’s order may be a small portion of a supplier’s overall
business (as is often the case in the electronics industry), the supplier may still feel that
it needs to work hard to keep the buying company’s business for the brand recognition,
with which it can attract other customers.
Where these dynamics – real or perceived – exist, a supplier may be less likely to push back
against the demands of the buying company. Where purchasing practices put pressure on
suppliers to either reduce cost or speed up production, this can result in a range of negative
child labour impacts. For example:
¡¡ Temporarily hiring children, including family members of existing workers.
¡¡ Demanding excessive working hours, which can lead young workers to work beyond
the hours allowed under national law, or to adult workers not being home to care for
their children, leading them to bring them to the workplace instead.
¡¡ Refusing reasonable breaks for workers, including young workers, exposing them to
potentially dangerous working conditions.
40
ILO-IOE CHILD LABOUR GUIDANCE TOOL FOR BUSINESS¡¡ Subcontracting part of the work to other suppliers who make use of child labour.
COMPANY PRACTICE No. 4
Smallholder capacity building and integration of
supply chain management
One company that procures an agricultural commodity in large quantities from smallholder
farmers has begun to put in place a system of farmer coaches, who help farmers meet
company requirements, including on child labour. The coaches also help analyse the cost of
production and support improving yields and quality to ensure higher incomes. This helps
decrease incentives to employ children.
The company has also made a strategic decision to vertically integrate large parts of its
supply chain, meaning it increasingly works directly with its smallholder suppliers, rather
than through agents. It has also made its procurement team directly responsible for dealing
with child labour that might occur on farms, thereby reducing the likelihood that smallholders
will receive mixed messages from buying and sourcing staff.
Practical approaches by companies
Companies that have taken a close look at their purchasing practices have often found that
they are the result of habit rather than necessity. Leading companies have taken a range of
steps, including:
¡¡ Proactively communicating about their short and medium-term needs to suppliers and
other business partners so that they can plan ahead appropriately.
¡¡ Enhancing alignment and collaboration between the purchasing team and sustainability
or responsible sourcing experts inside the buying company.
¡¡ Moving to integrate the two functions, making purchasing managers directly responsible
for social compliance in relation to the suppliers they buy from.
¡¡ Participating in industry or sector initiatives whose code requires members to evaluate
the role that purchasing practices can play in incentivising negative impacts by suppliers.

41Hard question No. 4
??
What is my company expected to do about child labour
impacts in commodities that are linked to our products
but occur several tiers removed from us in the value
chain?
The challenge
For many companies, seeking to mitigate child labour and other human rights risks beyond
the first tier of the value chain can feel like an overwhelming proposition. The UNGPs
help companies make difficult choices about allocating resources to prevent and address
impacts occurring across their value chains using the principle of severity of impact (See
Hard question No. 2).
Where a company has robust child labour policies and processes in place with regard to
the value chain, and has taken to steps to ensure that it is not inadvertently incentivising
suppliers to rely on child labour (see Hard question No. 3), it is unlikely to be contributing to
any such impacts. However, they may still be linked to its operations, products or services
because of the business relationships involved.
While companies are not expected to remedy impacts that they did not cause or contribute
to under the UNGPs, they are expected to take forward-looking steps to seek to prevent
the continuation or recurrence of the impacts. Typically this means exploring how to best
use leverage in relation to the most severe impacts with which they may be involved.
COMPANY PRACTICE No. 5
Examples of companies that are looking beyond
the first tier
The Coca-Cola Company has worked with ILO-IPEC and others to address child labour
in sugar cane farms that are often up to six tiers removed. The company has developed
publicly available due diligence checklists to support these efforts.
Through their employers’ associations, various apparel companies have supported
multilateral efforts to ensure that the Government of Uzbekistan ratifies and implements ILO
child labour conventions, resulting in reduced risk of child labour in Uzbek cotton production.
JTI has been working with ILO-IPEC to address the risk of child labour impacts at the level
of tobacco growing communities and among their 40,000 contractor farmers.
Nestlé is working with the Fair Labor Association to map child labour impacts in its cocoa
supply chain in Côte d’Ivoire and work at the community level to prevent and remedy them.
42
ILO-IOE CHILD LABOUR GUIDANCE TOOL FOR BUSINESSPractical approaches by companies
For example, in the sugarcane value chain (see Hard question No. 2), the risk of child labour
is highest for the millions of smallholder farms involved in cultivation. Smallholder farms sell
to a relatively small number of sugar mills, which in turn deliver the raw sugar to a much
larger group of traders, agents and companies. At the other end of the chain are a large
number of food and beverage companies, retailers and other brands.
Because they are the smallest in number and sit relatively close to where child labour
occurs, sugar mills can be considered a “pinch point”, or narrowest point in the supply
chain, where the relatively few number of actors increases the impact of any change in
practices. For companies in the sugarcane value chain, it therefore makes sense to engage
with the sugar mills directly where feasible, or participate in initiatives that seek to engage
with the mills, as leverage there is likely to be greatest. This is illustrated in the hypothetical
Figure 5.

PART C: PREVENTING AND ADDRESSING CHILD LABOUR IMPACTS: PRACTICAL STEPS FOR COMPANIES TO TAKE
Devising workable approaches to child labour impacts that are far removed from the
company’s own operations entails understanding how the value chain operates, the root
causes that lead to the use of child labour at relevant points in the chain, and where in the
chain a company’s leverage may be the greatest, either alone or in collaboration with other
actors.
43Hard question No. 5
??
My company participates in a multistakeholder initiative
to address child labour impacts. How do I evaluate its
role in light of the UNGPs?
The challenge
Effective approaches to risks at the far ends of the value chain will often require collaboration
with other actors. Formal collaborations between business, civil society organizations and
other actors – often referred to as multistakeholder initiatives (MSIs) – play an increasing role
in seeking to address these kinds of human rights risks.
MSIs can help set leading standards on a specific issue or for a specific sector, advocate for
better regulation and enforcement of existing standards with governments, provide a forum
for engagement with expert stakeholders, or help individual companies strengthen their due
diligence approaches by sharing accumulated experience.
In the past decade, several MSIs have been created to address child labour risks in a
collaborative fashion. These initiatives have had various levels of success. Some companies
have been tempted to move on individually, developing their own programmes and leaving
the MSI.
Ultimately, what matters from a UNGPs perspective is whether the company’s overall
approach to preventing and addressing child labour risks takes full account of where the
most severe impacts are occurring, and can demonstrate progress over time. Participation
in an MSI, or any other collective initiative, should always be reviewed with that objective
in mind.
Practical approaches by companies
Companies should be aware of the
specific role(s) that an MSI is intended
and able to play (e.g., provide a learning
forum for those new to the agenda), any
limitations in its ability to engage with key
stakeholders, and the fact that MSIs often
take time to establish a track record.
When evaluating the effectiveness of an
MSI in addressing child labour impacts,19
some companies have found it helpful to
consider a number of critical factors:
¡¡ Does the initiative focus on addressing
root causes of child labour?

45Track performance on
child labour
What is expected?
A company needs to review whether its efforts to prevent and address child labour impacts
with which it may be involved are effective over time. This is important for three reasons.
First, it helps strengthen the company’s efforts to prevent potential impacts. Second, where
the company identifies that it has caused or contributed to a negative impact, it helps to
ensure that the remedy that is provided is effective in practice (see Section C.7). Third,
tracking performance gives a company the information it needs to be ready to communicate
about its efforts on child labour with stakeholders (see Section C.5).
What are the key steps?
C.4.1 Systems for Tracking Responses: Companies will typically have a range of
systems that may be relevant to tracking effectiveness, such as internal audits, supplier
audits, systems to track occupational health and safety, engagement with trade unions,
or surveys of employees or external stakeholders. Measuring the effectiveness of the
company’s approach to addressing child labour impacts will involve both quantitative and
qualitative approaches.

prevent and address child labour impacts?
Diagnostic

üü Is tracking based on appropriate qualitative and quantitative indicators
(e.g., indicators derived from ILO child labour conventions, developed

 ILO-IPEC provides extensive information on child labour monitoring (CLM),
which is a form of tracking child labour. CLM at the local level involves regular direct
observation to identify child labourers and to determine the risks that they are
exposed to, referral of such children to appropriate services, verification that they have
been removed and tracking to ensure their situation has improved. CLM should ideally
be linked to and feed into national labour inspection systems; however, employers’
and workers’ organizations should also be closely involved given their direct presence
in the workplace. CLM is typically conducted through multidisciplinary teams that
can bring the necessary mix of skills and experience to a very complex task. To be
effective, CLM should be tied to a broader framework that brings together all parties
involved in both monitoring and using the information generated. Visit: www.ilo.org/

47Hard question No. 6
??
What is the appropriate role of audits in tracking the
effectiveness of our efforts on child labour impacts far
removed from us in the value chain?
The challenge
Many companies have existing systems for tracking performance on human rights issues in
their value chain, including supplier self-assessments and company-led or third party audits.
These existing systems are likely to include child labour impacts. The question is whether or
not they are effective.
Most supply chain management programmes
are currently characterised by “policing”
approaches. The underlying assumption in
these instances is that suppliers and other
business partners are unable or unwilling to
respect human rights, and therefore company
codes of conduct need to be imposed from
the top down. In order to avoid cheating, such
codes need to be policed through audits.
However,
this
assumption
underlying
compliance-based supply chain programmes
is often wrong. Suppliers may be willing to
meet standards but are unable to do so in
practice. Research demonstrates that with the
right support and enabling conditions, working
conditions can improve considerably.20
Leading audit firms are also recognising
the limitations of the audit model alone in
generating sustainable change.21
It is becoming increasingly clear that policing-
based audit programmes have limited effect
on their own in improving labour conditions for
workers and respect for their rights, including
preventing and addressing child labour. Some
of the reasons are summarised in the box
above.
In the child labour context, lessons from critical
interventions like those in the football industry
in Sialkot, Pakistan, illustrate the need to go
beyond auditing (which helped diagnose the

programme seeks to address root causes of child
labour, including by providing alternative sources
of income for families, educational opportunities for
young adolescents and awareness raising for parents.
In addition, the company trains its own agronomists
to detect child labour and escalate to the appropriate
level so that remediation can be provided. It also
participates in a sector-specific MSI to address child
labour through engagement at the policy level.

Understanding that auditing can be
an important diagnostic tool but that
it does not constitute a management
system in itself, leading companies
have started using a range of
innovative approaches (see table
below). Scaling up these approaches
remains a challenge. However,
companies are not expected to
have all the answers immediately.
Rather, they can be expected to
recognise the limitations of existing
audit-based approaches, and to
start to explore options with a focus
on the most severe risks to people
and taking into account expert
stakeholder views.
49Communicate performance
on child labour
What is expected?
Companies need to be prepared to communicate about their efforts to prevent and
mitigate child labour, in particular when concerns are raised by or about potentially affected
stakeholders. Companies that may be involved in severe child labour impacts should report
formally on their efforts.
What are the key steps?
C.5.1 Communication with stakeholders: The UNGPs expect that the form and
frequency of a company’s communications should reflect its human rights impacts.
üü If the company is or may be involved in severe child labour impacts, does
it report formally on how it addresses them?
üü Do any formal communications by the company include information or
observations from stakeholders, helping to increase its credibility?

At the same time, the UNGPs recognise that there will be legitimate limitations on the
ability to share information in certain circumstances. Those circumstances may include
when communicating certain information may pose risks to affected stakeholders or to
company personnel, or as a result of legitimate requirements of commercial confidentiality.

51Hard question No. 7
??
What information is meaningful to report about how my
company seeks to prevent and address child labour
impacts, especially where those impacts are continuing?
The challenge24
Many companies’ sustainability or corporate responsibility reports today are produced
using the concept of materiality. However, a focus solely on materiality, for which a multitude
of definitions exist, may leave salient human rights issues unaddressed.
Companies are supporting efforts to develop more refined approaches to human
rights reporting that are aligned with the UNGPs and the human rights standards that
it references, including the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at
Work. For example, a growing number of companies are turning to the UN Guiding
Principles Reporting Framework to strengthen their human rights disclosure.
The UNGP Reporting Framework is unique among existing non-financial reporting
initiatives in its focus on salient human rights issues: those human rights at risk of the
most severe negative impacts. The UNGP Reporting Framework helps companies
identify their salient human rights issues and focus their reporting – as well as their
underlying management efforts – on how these issues are prevented and addressed.
The focus for reporting is severe risks to people, not solely to the business.
Another challenge in human rights reporting more broadly, but particularly on an issue
like child labour, is that the discussion often focuses on voluntary efforts that a company
is undertaking through philanthropic or other programmes. Disclosure on philanthropic
programmes is often disconnected from any acknowledgement that, where a company’s
operations, products or services are linked to child labour impacts, it has a responsibility
under the UNGPs to seek to prevent and address such impacts through the use of leverage.
Social investment or philanthropic activities to support or promote the elimination and
remediation of child labour may be relevant from a UNGPs perspective where these form
part of a deliberate strategy to prevent and address child labour impacts with which
the company may be involved. However, as Reporting Principle D of the UN Guiding
Principles Reporting Framework makes clear, where this is not the case, a company should
ensure that this kind of information does not obscure or detract from its disclosure on how
it is seeking to meet its responsibility to respect human rights, including the right to be free
from child labour.
24 The UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework web site, draws on the analysis of problems with current
human rights reporting outlined at: www.ungpreporting.org/resources/faq.

ILO-IOE CHILD LABOUR GUIDANCE TOOL FOR BUSINESSPractical approaches by companies
¡¡ Providing details about any child labour impacts arising in audit findings (e.g., number of
child labourers identified), and how the company uses its leverage to try to ensure that
these impacts are addressed (e.g., helping a supplier institute procedures for verifying
and documenting proof of age to avoid future instances of hiring underage workers).
¡¡ Conducting and sharing research on the prevalence and nature of child labour in sub-
sectors, communities and countries from which the company sources.
¡¡ Explaining how the company’s operations may be directly linked to child labour impacts
even if it does not occur in the company’s own operations or those of its immediate
business partners (e.g., a tourism company that does not have child labour in its own
operations but operates in contexts where child labour is a significant risk in other parts
of the tourism value chain, such as the production and sale of souvenirs).
¡¡ Making public full or summary versions of third party assessments of the effectiveness
of the company’s approach to child labour in specific high-risk contexts.
¡¡ Describing who the company works with to remediate instances of child labour where
they are found, the partner’s relevant expertise, and how those partnerships are
structured.
¡¡ Sharing case studies that explain the complex dynamics that lead to child labour in a
certain sector or country context, the various actors that need to be engaged in efforts
to meaningfully address the situation, and the particular role the company is playing or
intends to play as part of that picture, depending on how it is involved with the impact
(cause, contribution or linkage).
¡¡ Information that helps convey the company’s year-to-year performance on the issue,
and the effect that any programmes have over time on root causes of child labour.
PART C: PREVENTING AND ADDRESSING CHILD LABOUR IMPACTS: PRACTICAL STEPS FOR COMPANIES TO TAKE
Where child labour is a salient human rights issue for a company, there is a range
of information that companies can provide to illustrate the company’s approach to
preventing and addressing child labour impacts. Examples from recent company
disclosure include:
53Stakeholder engagement
What is expected?
Meaningful engagement with people who may be impacted, or their legitimate representatives,
is an integral part of human rights due diligence. This includes due diligence in regard to
child labour impacts. Such engagement helps the company to have a full understanding of
how its actions and decisions can affect children and their families.
Engagement with potentially affected stakeholders is particularly important under the
UNGPs when assessing impacts (to understand how the company might be involved with
child labour impacts) and tracking performance (to assess the extent to which prevention
and mitigation measures have been successful). However, in the case of children at risk
of child labour, extreme care needs to be taken in considering such direct engagement.
Companies will often need to consult knowledgeable sources about child labour instead of
potentially affected children themselves.
What are the key steps?
C.6.1 Engagement with potentially affected stakeholders: Companies should engage
with those people who may be impacted by their operations and take their views into
account. Where such engagement is not possible, as will often be the case with children at
risk of child labour, the company should consider how to gain insight into those children’s
perspectives through engagement with local and/or expert stakeholders who do have
access to those children or can credibly reflect their perspectives. In considering direct
engagement with children, companies need to pay particular attention to their special
vulnerability and follow expert guidance on how to engage appropriately.
üü Does the company seek to engage with potentially affected children
or their families, particularly in regards to assessing its impacts and
tracking the effectiveness of its responses?
Diagnostic
Questions
üü Does the company follow expert guidance when designing or
conducting any such direct engagement with children?
üü Where such engagement is not possible, does the company consult
credible proxies for children’s views, such as local children’s rights
experts or community-based organizations?
C.6.2 Engaging other stakeholders: As noted in Section C.3, governments are critical
actors to engage in sustainable efforts to remediate child labour impacts. Companies will
want to engage other relevant stakeholders at different points in their management of
child labour risks. These other relevant stakeholders may include representatives of trade
unions, policy-focused civil society organizations, international organizations and individual
54
ILO-IOE CHILD LABOUR GUIDANCE TOOL FOR BUSINESSgovernments. These stakeholders may serve as important sources of information or as
partners for collaborative action to prevent and address child labour impacts.
üü How often and in what ways does the company engage with such
stakeholders about these issues?
Diagnostic
Questions
üü Can and do stakeholders themselves initiate engagement with the
company about these issues?
üü What are the objectives of such engagement and are these objectives
met in practice? If not, why not?
üü How do the views of such stakeholders influence the company’s
decisions and actions?
C.6.3 Vulnerable and marginalised groups: Children can be among the most
vulnerable of potentially affected stakeholders. In addition, there may be children who
belong to groups of people that are at heightened risk of vulnerability or marginalisation.
These groups may include indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, certain religious groups,
people of a certain descent or caste, or migrant workers from another country. There may
also be very different impacts on boys and girls.
Diagnostic
Questions
i
üü Does the company take into account impacts on children from groups
or populations that may be at heightened risk of vulnerability or
marginalisation? How?
üü Does the company consider the different kinds of impacts that can be
experienced by boys and girls? How?

üü How does the company identify other relevant stakeholders to engage

55Remedy and
grievance mechanisms
What is expected?
When a company identifies that it has caused or contributed to a child labour impact, it
has a responsibility to provide for or cooperate in legitimate processes for providing remedy
for that impact. Remediation in the context of child labour is a delicate and often complex
process and requires appropriate expertise. It is worth reiterating that while companies are
not expected to provide remedy for impacts that they do not cause or contribute to under
the UNGPs, they may choose to do so or may contribute to broader remediation efforts as
part of a forward-looking approach to seek to mitigate the risk of such impacts continuing
or recurring (see Section B.3).
Step 4 of the Guide Two of ILO-IOE Guides for Employers25 sets out helpful guidance for
employers to consider when taking action to remediate child labour. In the guide, employers
are advised to be aware that dismissal of child labourers, without considering how to
replace the lost family income, can be very dangerous.
Companies should establish or participate in effective operational-level grievance
mechanisms to help identify and address instances of child labour. They should also
encourage, and where appropriate, require their business partners to have such mechanisms
in place. The UNGPs make clear that such grievance mechanisms should be as close to
the level of impact as possible (e.g., the factory floor or at the community level), and should
not preclude access to judicial mechanisms or undermine the role of trade unions, and
applicable industrial relations processes.
It is particularly challenging to design mechanisms that are appropriate for children to use.
Typically, grievance mechanisms are accessed by adults on behalf of children, or with
the interests of children in mind, such as trade unions, local community representatives,
company staff with responsibility for visiting or engaging with field or local staff, third party
assessors or auditors, civil society organizations championing children’s rights and others.
Given that sustainable remediation of child labour impacts is closely linked to efforts to
address root causes of child labour, it is usually important for companies to understand
what remediation processes and grievance mechanisms exist at the State level, and how
the company may rely on, or support, these processes and mechanisms through its own
efforts. National employer organizations can advise and support companies in this regard.

56
ILO-IOE CHILD LABOUR GUIDANCE TOOL FOR BUSINESSWhat are the key steps?
üü What processes does the company have in place to provide for or
participate in remedy where it causes or contributes to a child labour
impact?
Diagnostic
Questions
üü Are these processes reflected in company policies or procedures?
üü Do these processes ensure that the best interests of the child are
protected whatever approach is taken? How?
üü Has the company experienced challenges in providing remedy in cases
where it identifies it has caused or contributed to child labour? If so,
how were these addressed?
C.7.2 Operational-level grievance mechanisms: The UNGPs provide that any non-
judicial grievance mechanism should meet certain criteria to be effective. Companies
should make sure that their own mechanisms and others that they engage with or promote
meet the criteria below (see Guiding Principle 31 for additional information).
In some contexts there are specific national mechanisms focused on the protection of
children (for example, in relation to sexual exploitation of children in travel and tourism). In
such cases, individual companies should support those mechanisms by promoting them
with stakeholders, business partners and others as a primary point of recourse.
PART C: PREVENTING AND ADDRESSING CHILD LABOUR IMPACTS: PRACTICAL STEPS FOR COMPANIES TO TAKE
C.7.1 Establish or participate in remediation processes: A company should
be prepared to take action to provide remedy when it has caused or contributed to a
child labour impact. It should have established procedures in place that are in line with
international standards and expert guidance.
57Has the company established or does it participate in an effective,
operational-level grievance mechanism that can help identify and address
instances of child labour?
Does the grievance mechanism meet the following criteria? Is it:
üü Legitimate (is it trusted by potential users);
üü Accessible (is it known to potential users and is assistance provided to
those who may face barriers to accessing it);
üü Predictable (does it offer a clear and known procedure);
Diagnostic
Questions
üü Equitable (do users have sufficient access to information and support
in order to engage on fair, informed and respectful terms);
üü Transparent (are parties kept informed about progress);
üü Rights-compatible (are the remedies provided in line with international
human rights standards);
üü A source of continuous learning (does it identify lessons for preventing
future harm);
üü Based on engagement and dialogue (are potential users consulted in
the design and performance of the mechanism, and does it focus on
dialogue as a means to resolve grievances)?
C.7.3 The role of business partners in providing remedy: Where a company contributes
to a child labour impact through a business partner or supplier (for example, as a result of
pressure arising from its purchasing practices), the other party may be best placed to take
the lead in providing remedy because it may be closest to where the impact occurred. In
cases of contribution, the company is nonetheless also expected to participate in remedy
to the extent of its contribution.
Where the company has not caused or contributed to an impact, it should still encourage
or require its business partner to provide remedy. Companies have found that they need
to consider supporting or incentivising business partners that face legitimate constraints if
such requirements are to be effective in practice, such as due to costs.
Diagnostic
Questions
58
üü What steps does the company take to encourage or require its
business partners, suppliers and others to have effective grievance
mechanisms in place and to provide remedy where they cause or
contribute to a child labour impact?
üü How does the company know if those mechanisms are effective, and if
the remedies provided are in line with the best interests of the children
involved?
