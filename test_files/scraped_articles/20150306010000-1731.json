Deepika Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT Some of the publications of the National Law School of India University. Are laws and their legal aspects baffling? Frequently asked questions (FAQs) will come the rescue, as always. Enterprising teams of programme heads and researchers from the National Law School of India University (NLSIU) are bringing out booklets containing FAQs on important laws and legislations. The booklets are available at Rs. 30 onwards. Among the issues and Acts that have been covered are child abuse, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, child marriage, child labour, National Food Security Act, and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act. V.P. Niranjan Aradhya, Fellow at the Centre for Child and the Law, NLSIU said the booklets are aimed at simplifying laws for the common man. In the pipeline is an FAQ booklet in Kannada (a first) on the RTE Act, replete with graphics. “We realised that people in rural areas did not know much about the RTE Act. This will create awareness among the stakeholders,” Mr. Aradhya said. A pocket calendar, designed to popularise RTE Act, was released recently. Samuel Sathyaseelan, publications in-charge at the Centre for Child and the Law, said these booklets take months to be put together. “We have to incorporate revisions, passing of Bills in Parliament and other factors before publishing them,” he explained. “We don’t have an editorial board but people with expertise help us. Being from a National Law School, we will have to be doubly careful.” Some of the booklets, like the one on the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) are being used as training material for police personnel.
