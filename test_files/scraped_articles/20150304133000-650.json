{"content":" The doctrine of money has helped destroy New Jersey: Letter By South Jersey Times Letters To the Editor: In the 20th century it was the unions that helped the worker win a middle class lifestyle. The unions brought us the 40-hour work week and overtime pay. They abolished child labor and improved safety in the workplace. But in the second half of the 20th century the unions began to raise demands that were impossible to fulfill and a lot of industry left New Jersey. In 1968, the public unions got the right of collective bargaining and local and state government workers began to raise demands of the most senseless kind whose fulfillment is now impossible. And it was compliant elected officials that offered the most shameless promises. Gradually manufacturing was replaced by government spending as the heart of New Jersey's economy, shattering the foundation of our state's economy. Parallel to this, the Democrat Party grew in strength in our state, to the point we don't even have a Republican Party here in Gloucester County anymore. The leadership of the AFL-CIO is the leadership of the Democrat Party in South Jersey. Local government workers rule these towns. Now we must find a way to meet the huge public pension obligation. I suggest we reduce state spending on \"eds and meds,\" especially in the poor, mostly urban areas. It's time to cut this burden loose in our low-income communities. Also, we should raise the state income tax to 10 percent on incomes above $250,000. I don't feel sorry for employers who have had their labor resource subsidized by the government. And it's these business owners that do not want full employment because it would cause a scarcity in the supply of labor, which would push wages up. Surely, money is the root of all evil. I hate money.
