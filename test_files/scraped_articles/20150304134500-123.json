Submitted as part of the Ninth Regional Meeting of the Latin American and Caribbean Movement for Boys, Girls and Adolescent Workers (Molacnats), the event was attended, among others, by Venezuelan, Bolivian and Paraguayan minors, between 10 and 12 years of age, with technicians and experts. In Paraguay there are still 450 000 working children who ask to be respected, not to be exploited either sexually or psychologically. The Young report their own experiences, they are workers who need to work in appropriate conditions and security in order to help support their families. The main objective of the forum is to convey the right concept of child labor from a cultural, social and economic point of view. The International Labour Organization has an ongoing campaign for the eradication of child labor but, according to the young delegates of some Countries, it is not suitable for all cultures and needs.
