Today, we’re talking about Chipotle’s latest legal settlement. Chipotle Mexican Grill has agreed to pay the State of New Jersey $7.75 million for thousands of violations of child labor laws, the state announced on Tuesday. Chipotle will require training for managers on the state’s child labor laws under the terms of the settlement. The fast-casual chain based in Newport Beach, Calif. also named a child compliance officer and said it will audit its own practices. The settlement is a result of a 2020 audit done by the state of New Jersey into Chipotle that found more than 30,000 violations including instances of minors working past the 40-hour work week and not being given enough meal breaks. Under New Jersey law , 14- and 15-year-olds can work up to 40 hours a week when school is out of session, with 30-minute meal breaks after five hours of work. They’re allowed to work up to 18 hours a week during school months. Sixteen and 17-year-olds can work up to 40 hours a week with 30-minute meal breaks year-round. Hear what I have to say on the matter. Plus, catch up on all the top news of the day with our daily news recap at the beginning of each episode.
