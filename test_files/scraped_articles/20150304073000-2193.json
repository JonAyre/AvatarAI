Mr. Gibson also told the conference that The\nBahamas was most honoured to participate in and join forces with other\ncountries around the world in discussions on pressing labour issues, including\nthe role of employment and social protection, and the reduction of poverty and\nequality at the 18 th American Regional Meeting of the ILO in Lima,\nPeru in October 2014.
