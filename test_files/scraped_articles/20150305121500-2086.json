But a few days ago, things took a serious turn when a user posted an image of a family having a meal at Xander's, a well-known eatery on Karachi's E Street, and their two maids standing in a corner, taking care of their child. The image was initially posted on Twitter and has been retweeted over 1,200 times since. People instantly jumped to conclusions and deemed the family monsters. One user on Facebook said, \"If a maid can take care of your child, why can't she sit at the same table?\" Another chimed in, \"The so-called upper class has no class.\" One woman classified them as unlawful citizens: \"Child labour is a crime and these people are culprits.\" The debate raised several questions relating to privacy, class stratification and labour law. While it's true that for some, a secretly taken photograph of a family enjoying a meal out would constitute an invasion of privacy, for others if this helps expose a social issue it's justified. And while some criticised the family for not giving their staff a seat at the table, others claimed their own staff feels uncomfortable partaking in family meals and may prefer an alternative situation. What do restaurant owners feel? The incident exposes the ugly side of upper class society, a segment that usually includes restaurant owners themselves. So we asked a few restaurant owners to give us their take on the incident, and what, if any, policies they feel could be implemented for the future. Xander's, where the incident took place and the site of the infamous photograph, has been thrown into the spotlight. Owner Alexandre Rizvi gives us his side of the story: \"I questioned my staff about what happened and they informed me that the maids had been seated with their employers initially. When the child they were taking care of got fussy they got up to walk around a little to calm him down. In those few minutes, a picture was taken and put up on social media and blown way out of proportion.\" He adds, \"You can’t just take pictures of people out for dinner with their family. It’s unethical and a complete invasion of privacy.” Restaurant owners may have to flout the rule 'the customer is always right' Saima Achria of The Patio says, \"As owners, we can't be dictating social values and making rules as to how customers treat their domestic staff. However we have never experienced such an incident: our customers generally allow their staff to sit and offer them a drink or even a meal in some cases.\" Abid Merchant of Fika raises an important point: \"There’s been talk on KFD about how a separate area being allocated to them could solve the issue. Again, that’s discriminatory also and not really possible for restaurant owners to do when they’ve got an intimate, small place. If people do bring their maids along, they should definitely make them sit at the same table. If they're not going to do that, then they shouldn't bring them out at all because such discriminatory behaviour is unacceptable.\" Talking to Muhammad Ali Teli, the owner of Pantry, he shares his experience, stating: \"Just a few days ago, I had a lady come with her maid and she asked the young girl if she’d like some juice and she said yes. The waiter inquired whether the woman would like her to have boxed juice or fresh juice (the latter obviously being slightly pricier) and the woman said give her fresh juice, the same that we’re having. The majority of customers don’t discriminate but there are some who do and with such progressive social media, they are bound to get caught.\" Does social media bring out the worst in us or the best? Alexandre of Xander's told us that the people in the picture came to him, furious, demanding the CCTV footage from that night be released so they can silence the attacks being hurled at them in the virtual world. The Xander's team is working on locating the footage. There's no doubt that the ease with which photos can be shared online is both a curse and a blessing, depending on which party you are. In this case, the possibility of being shamed in public may police behaviour. Also on KFD, a group member posted this comment: \"Funny story, a couple of days ago I went to Xander's with some friends. There was a group of ladies where one of them had a maid and a baby. Whilst giving the waiter the order, one of the ladies (referring to her maid) said \" Bhai sab say pehlay isskay liyay kursi laado, pata nahin kaun Facebook per humein zaleel karday (first things first, please bring out a chair for her to be seated on — who knows who will shame us on Facebook).\" There's no denying this incident sheds light on an uncomfortable system that most Pakistanis engage with every day: depending on domestic staff members to take care of intimate aspects of life such as child rearing while treating them as lower-class citizens at the same time.

This is not a biggie, just a normal routine on daily basis at the restaurants, there are people who cannot leave their kids at home because they do not have the luxury of elders or other family members baby sitting hence we should show a bit of tolerance as this could be any of us some day. Recommend 0 IMRAN QASIM Mar 05, 2015 04:37pm This is pathetic and very unfortunate. \r\n\nPakistan ranks high in charity but ranks very low in treating poor people with love and care. Recommend 0 Zak Mar 05, 2015 04:44pm In Islam , in situations like this, servants are to eat along with employers.

This is where the Europenas sore ove people for the sub-continent. And we blame them for being racists. Recommend 0 Asad Amin Mar 05, 2015 04:49pm I really can not understand when we are responsible for birth of our children then why we can not take care of them ? \r\nIts duty of parents to look after their children not some poor maid or servant. We have two kids but we never hire any maid for them. When ever we go to hotel kids tease us a lot and we can not eat properly and majority of our time is spend looking after them but we never think of hiring some maid. \r\nIts totally child labor and child abuse. Recommend 0 Azhar Hussain Mar 05, 2015 04:50pm This type of discrimination happens all the time in the upper class households of Pakistan. It all boils down to strong laws and its implementation, and here lies the underlining cultural values instilled in our people. That's very sorry state of affair, but we need to bring it out and let the people decide. Recommend 0 Basit Khan Mar 05, 2015 04:55pm \"When the child they were taking care of got fussy they got up to walk around a little to calm him down.\"\r\n\nOh yeah, both the maids got up in unison to walk around the child.

Recommend 0 SAAB93 Mar 05, 2015 05:24pm Maids all over the world are given space on the same table just besides younger kids. Maids are supposed to have something to eat with the family and also keep a close eye on babies. Parents are also supposed to take care of both the kids and their maids while dining out. the people who degrade their maids publicly, must not be allowed to employ maids. Recommend 0 excalibur Mar 05, 2015 05:25pm it is pure unIslamic and racist behaviour/ Period Recommend 0 Moosa Mar 05, 2015 05:30pm Either version can be true. But we need to think about what the real issue is here. Leave aside privacy of the family, discrimination of maids....we need to learn how to respect others, even if they are our servants. Cuz at the end of the day, everyone's respect is equal and they are there to help us out. Without them we wouldnt be able to live like we do. Give them respect and show that you care. Not cuz of fear of FB or Twitter, but fear of Allah. Our servants have a right on us...right that we treat them as out equal. \r\nLady Fatima (daughter of Prophet PBUH) had a maid (kaneez). Lady Fatima used to take turns and help the maid in the house chores. When such personalities give such regards to their servants, the least we can do it respect them. Recommend 0 A.Rafique Mar 05, 2015 05:36pm Completely out of control , use of social media to stirr up this type of nonsense. Does n't the family dining in a restaurant deserve some privacy ? Recommend 0 Nadia Mar 05, 2015 05:37pm @Harmony the maid will still have the job, the difference will be that she wont be derogated at social places being a maid. i agree with Asad Amin, living most of my life abroad with all the luxuries bestowed by the Almighty on our family. we never had any maid, never!!! but its a status symbol these days, roam around with a maid for the child. if one cant manage them then why do they even conceive them? Recommend 0 Isabella Niaz Mar 05, 2015 05:39pm Ok this may be one incident where things were blown out of proportion but what about all the other times when we witness such events? It is nothing new I've seen this way too many times when people stuff themselves but are too poor at heart to get their maids even a pack of fries. Seen it in Ziafat, Burger King, Nandos, Barcelos etc. Recommend 0 Syed Ganga Din Mar 05, 2015 05:41pm See how Pakistanis behave especially when they have a few bucks to spend. See the problem any one? Recommend 0 Syed Ganga Din Mar 05, 2015 05:44pm @A.Rafique : You want privacy, stay home. Once you are in a public place, there is no privacy. Besides it has nothing to do with privacy, it simply shows a pathetic behaviour of a low class family with some money in their pockets. Recommend 0 khanm Mar 05, 2015 05:48pm If you want to gauge a persons's character, morals, and values. See how he treats his servants.The irony is majority of those people are quite educated...If education does not create a need for the best in life, then we are stuck in a rigid caste society.We need tarbiat as well... Sorry to say.... we have not eliminated the caste system.. it is the part of our society. The legacy we inherited from Brits and the Indian culture........ Recommend 0 umer salahuddin Mar 05, 2015 05:53pm They should not bring domestic maids for their dinner and if they did then they should be served same food which this family had taken. Recommend 0 Goga Nalaik Mar 05, 2015 05:54pm Such discriminations are so common in Pakistan especially in the areas and restaurants frequented by this high society. Instead of arguing about their clients privacy and bla bla bla, these restaurant owners can easily allocate a space in their restaurants where such people (maids, drivers) can sit and have a meal with dignity. Regarding cost of this meal, its very simple: just raise the food prices by 2 or 3% (clients will not even bother about it) and keep this difference to provide free food to maids and drivers. Recommend 0 Abu.Ashhad Mar 05, 2015 05:55pm few days ago my wife showed me this picture and I was not sure to comment anything on that as its only a picture. Mostly I am not believing on such social media stuff. this picture can be taken other way around too.\r\nI request to all readers please try to educate the people around you how to use and utilize social media in better way. Recommend 0 SN Mar 05, 2015 06:01pm our customers generally allow there staff to sit and offer them a drink or even a meal in some cases\r\n\nOh good for them they even allow meals! Recommend 0 Zo Mar 05, 2015 06:03pm First and foremost, the purpose of KFD is not to discuss who treats whom right. Instead, it speaks about the quality of food. Therefore, the image should have been removed in the very first instance. Another issue is that it is a clear invasion into privacy of the individuals, having dinner. First of all, people need to be sure of what is actually happening there, before making any comments on the incident. For all you know, the child kept crying and as a consequence, the maid had no option but to walk and calm the baby. It was not like they were abusing these maids. Child rearing is a scientific debate, with its uses being documented by it, therefore, for us to drag the debate of child rearing is not wrong either. It is small incidents like this that tend to earn the attention of people in such a manner, that actual problems are forgotten. Recommend 0 Harmony Mar 05, 2015 06:05pm @Nadia - you are commenting without reading. My reply was to someone who said they don't like employing maids. Recommend 0 A Citizen Mar 05, 2015 06:06pm Pakistanis with more money than decency or common sense resort to such behaviours. \r\n\nPakistan does not have an \"upper class\" in the real sense of the word. Most (nouveau riche) rich or super rich do not have real role models to follow. Hence these behaviours in public too. Recommend 0 Noor Mar 05, 2015 06:06pm \"customers generally allow there staff to sit and offer them a drink or even a meal in some cases.\"\r\nin SOME cases.\r\n Wow, very classy and highly humble of you guys! Please don't even bother offering your staff a drink next time. They owe you nothing, you know. Its not like they left the safety and love of their families at the age of 5 in order to go work in strange homes where they treated like lesser humans.

And in general we are a nation who likes to point fingers. Recommend 0 Smot Mar 05, 2015 07:13pm I would never be eating peacefully when my child is crying. Period. Look at the way the baby is hugging the maid, that should have been the mom. Ofcourse to put up the pic on social media and judging the family is absolutely wrong. I'm sure the mom is a good mom,and this is just a random click. Recommend 0 Nasim Mar 05, 2015 07:19pm Its unethical and immoral behaviour on their part. Please take a chill pill. Recommend 0 fawad Mar 05, 2015 07:21pm in the picture there is one empty chair nd two girl and a kid standing out. And looks that the kid was sitting there. Statement of restaurant owner seems wrong.\r\nPeople shouldn't bring maids to restaurant if they can't feed them, or can offer JUST juice while they eat meal. Recommend 0 Riz Mar 05, 2015 07:26pm I think if the story is half narrated then defnitely everyone get the wrong picture. If Alexendre is right and maid was just ask to stand for baby to stop crying then it is fine until she was sat again. But didn't understand the reason for second maid to stand??\r\nI myself have dinner with my brother (driver). Sometime i take him to Bar BQ tonight and sometime at some Dhaba. No body will notice good things about society. Recommend 0 ZackKhan Mar 05, 2015 07:30pm I have been living in USA since 1983, and have been to Pakistan quiet a few times and every time I go my heart bleeds the way my own relative treats their \"servants\". My relative are considered as elite of the society and they go on charities and fund raising dinners, they have also lived in UK for long time and have visited more countries than cities I have to....the point here is when you live in Pakistan you just become heartless and you won't even know what you are doing...narrow thinking and social pressure makes you do things you know is wrong! Recommend 0 Assad Mar 05, 2015 07:35pm Does anybody remember a Child maid was brutally tortured a few days ago in Lahore. Just because you can take picture and share them on Social media does not make you an ambassador for human rights. Recommend 0 lkhan Mar 05, 2015 07:43pm What is most distressing is, the girl maids at the above restaurant themselves are minors, should not be working especially at that hour, instead be with their families at night, and in schools during the day. Alas, this is what most Pakistanis of the so called elite class do not consider, or care about. No empathy for the poverty stricken, indeed more for their pets rather than people, totally blinded to their misery and suffering... Recommend 0 Syed Ahmed, Canada Mar 05, 2015 07:44pm Don't bring the maid servants to restaurant's if you feel ashamed to share the space on the dining table and same food. It is disgusting. The helper who cleans our apartment weekly sits on the same dining table at home and share the same food with us. Recommend 0 ayesha Mar 05, 2015 07:46pm Why can't parents take care of their own kids? Why would they bring their maids to a restaurant in the first place so what if the kids will bug for a while...I feel its very cruel to bring them even if you make them sit with you & order food for them, its a life style they can never afford they can never go their with their families so why test their faith. Recommend 0 lkhan Mar 05, 2015 07:47pm By the way, today very few call people in the west address those employed to look after children, homes as maids - the common word is caretaker, or if highly trained, a nanny. Neither the term servant nor maid is much appreciated..... Recommend 0 Nas Mar 05, 2015 07:57pm My friend roaming round in the restaurant is abosultly not Normal, Many people are there to escape th reality No to get bothered by crying child or a house maid pacing up & daown to put the child to sleep....Restaurants should not allow House Maids or they shoul sit with the upper class on the same table Recommend 0 Arsalan Kamal Mar 05, 2015 08:07pm The problem is not whether domestic staff should be seated at the sahib's table or not. The world over it is normal not to have domestic staff at the table. \r\n\nIts an employer/employee relationship.\r\n\nThe problem in our culture is our inability to treat domestic staff as employees. Paying a pittance, employing underage/school age childern, we tend to think of domestic staff as our chattel. They are human beings and need to have their dignity respected but moneyed classes in our society have a long way to go in having confidence in themselves before they will understand this. Recommend 0 femme Mar 05, 2015 08:08pm The poll question is wrong. Do you think people should bring thier domestic staff outside with them. Yes i think they should. The domestic staff needs to get out of the house as well. How they treat them outside is another issue. Recommend 0 Cyrus Ho Mar 05, 2015 08:18pm I am not commenting here. I am listening to your voices. Recommend 0 Iqbal Mar 05, 2015 08:29pm This article seems to side with the family along with restaurant owners. Most of the comments are for or against the family and some are against the person taking picture. \r\n\nThe main issue is the treatment of domestic workers and their rights. Every human being deserve respect regardless of what job they do. If domestic workers are not treated right then the people need to be shamed and exposed (we know that the law does not work in Pakistan so the shaming is probably the only way) . \r\n\nHats of to the person who took this picture and started the debate. Recommend 0 Ali Vazir Mar 05, 2015 08:34pm 1) This is definitely breach of privacy.\r\n2) This is how our society is, discriminatory, but not only ours, majority of the world is like that, in their own way. The recent killings of unarmed blacks at the hands of white policemen in US; denying hearing a woman in Canadian court due to head scarf; insulting Non-Arabs in Saudia; calling a rape victim responsible for the crime (against women); are a few examples. We need to work on our own selves first, demonstrate a good example and then can spread the word.\r\n3) The survey at the bottom has 2 options. There should be the 3rd option \"As they wish\". None of other person's business. Recommend 0 N. Rahim Mar 05, 2015 08:36pm Where is the Pakistani sense of human values gone? Recommend 0 Khalid Mar 05, 2015 09:22pm This is exactly the kind of people we are. I am not surprised at all. We treat servants worse than how slaves were treated in the days of slavery. One of the girls looks like a child herself. The excuse that they were sitting with their \"masters\" a few minutes before the picture was taken is nothing but a lie. Makes me ashamed to belong to the same society. Recommend 0 lafanga Mar 05, 2015 09:31pm A certain segment of South Asian society (Pakistan/India) ONLY wants to have babies BUT not look after them. Going to a restaurant should be a family experience and bonding with the children if they go along. What's the point of having Children if maid is going to look after them 24/7. Recommend 0 Mariam Mar 05, 2015 09:48pm You know what really bothers me? The girl in the black scarf looks to be no more that 14 yrs old. That's child labour. \r\nTo be honest, I have seen quite a few well off families with young boys or girls taking care of their children. They are paid a pittance, with no fixed work hours. What is pathetic is how these people rationalise child labour: 'Atleast we give food and pay or he/she would be out on the road doing god knows what' 'They have no future anyway, atleast we are giving them a job' ' We are actually helping them and giving them a stable life'\r\n\nHonestly, if you really want to 'help' these poor kids, how about sponsoring their education instead? Recommend 0 Sayyar Khan Mar 05, 2015 09:50pm Just a shameful society. I know one thing its not as bad in KPK then compare to rest of the country. Maybe I am wrong but that's what I have noticed. Recommend 0 Masood Haider Mar 05, 2015 09:50pm If a family dining out was seen brutally beating one of the children would that be a private matter?

That is our real picture and practice. We treat our servants like children of lesser God. I have seen and know lot ( I mean lot, some 80 % ) of homes where cheaper food is also cooked for maids. This is all over the world. Once while visiting USA with my family ( Laredo, Texas ) I bought meal for a ten years boy who asked for food and looked femish, asked him to eat with my two daughters. The restaurant manager got very upset claiming I was ruining his eatery image and refused to serve us food. We went o a fast food restaurant and eat there, but we were constantly stared at by other customers. Being poor is the biggest crime of all.

Recommend 0 Popular Facebook group Karachi Food Diary (KFD) usually features debates about which khao suey is the best in town. But a few days ago, things took a serious turn when a user posted an image of a family having a meal at Xander's, a well-known eatery on Karachi's E Street, and their two maids standing in a corner, taking care of their child. The image was initially posted on Twitter and has been retweeted over 1,200 times since. People instantly jumped to conclusions and deemed the family monsters. One user on Facebook said, \"If a maid can take care of your child, why can't she sit at the same table?\" Another chimed in, \"The so-called upper class has no class.\" One woman classified them as unlawful citizens: \"Child labour is a crime and these people are culprits.\" The debate raised several questions relating to privacy, class stratification and labour law. While it's true that for some, a secretly taken photograph of a family enjoying a meal out would constitute an invasion of privacy, for others if this helps expose a social issue it's justified. And while some criticised the family for not giving their staff a seat at the table, others claimed their own staff feels uncomfortable partaking in family meals and may prefer an alternative situation. The incident exposes the ugly side of upper class society, a segment that usually includes restaurant owners themselves. So we asked a few restaurant owners to give us their take on the incident, and what, if any, policies they feel could be implemented for the future. Xander's, where the incident took place and the site of the infamous photograph, has been thrown into the spotlight. Owner Alexandre Rizvi gives us his side of the story: \"I questioned my staff about what happened and they informed me that the maids had been seated with their employers initially. When the child they were taking care of got fussy they got up to walk around a little to calm him down. In those few minutes, a picture was taken and put up on social media and blown way out of proportion.\" He adds, \"You can’t just take pictures of people out for dinner with their family. It’s unethical and a complete invasion of privacy.” Saima Achria of The Patio says, \"As owners, we can't be dictating social values and making rules as to how customers treat their domestic staff. However we have never experienced such an incident: our customers generally allow their staff to sit and offer them a drink or even a meal in some cases.\" Abid Merchant of Fika raises an important point: \"There’s been talk on KFD about how a separate area being allocated to them could solve the issue. Again, that’s discriminatory also and not really possible for restaurant owners to do when they’ve got an intimate, small place. If people do bring their maids along, they should definitely make them sit at the same table. If they're not going to do that, then they shouldn't bring them out at all because such discriminatory behaviour is unacceptable.\" Talking to Muhammad Ali Teli, the owner of Pantry, he shares his experience, stating: \"Just a few days ago, I had a lady come with her maid and she asked the young girl if she’d like some juice and she said yes. The waiter inquired whether the woman would like her to have boxed juice or fresh juice (the latter obviously being slightly pricier) and the woman said give her fresh juice, the same that we’re having. The majority of customers don’t discriminate but there are some who do and with such progressive social media, they are bound to get caught.\" Alexandre of Xander's told us that the people in the picture came to him, furious, demanding the CCTV footage from that night be released so they can silence the attacks being hurled at them in the virtual world. The Xander's team is working on locating the footage. There's no doubt that the ease with which photos can be shared online is both a curse and a blessing, depending on which party you are. In this case, the possibility of being shamed in public may police behaviour. Also on KFD, a group member posted this comment: \"Funny story, a couple of days ago I went to Xander's with some friends. There was a group of ladies where one of them had a maid and a baby. Whilst giving the waiter the order, one of the ladies (referring to her maid) said \" Bhai sab say pehlay isskay liyay kursi laado, pata nahin kaun Facebook per humein zaleel karday (first things first, please bring out a chair for her to be seated on — who knows who will shame us on Facebook).\" There's no denying this incident sheds light on an uncomfortable system that most Pakistanis engage with every day: depending on domestic staff members to take care of intimate aspects of life such as child rearing while treating them as lower-class citizens at the same time.

Therefore, the image should have been removed in the very first instance. Another issue is that it is a clear invasion into privacy of the individuals, having dinner. First of all, people need to be sure of what is actually happening there, before making any comments on the incident. For all you know, the child kept crying and as a consequence, the maid had no option but to walk and calm the baby. It was not like they were abusing these maids. Child rearing is a scientific debate, with its uses being documented by it, therefore, for us to drag the debate of child rearing is not wrong either.

Recommend 0 Waqar Mar 05, 2015 07:08pm Guys read the whole article just don't comment based the posted picture:-),,,for your convenience please see below:-) \r\n\n\"I questioned my staff about what happened and they informed me that the maids had been seated with their employers initially. When the child they were taking care of got fussy they got up to walk around a little to calm him down. In those few minutes, a picture was taken and put up on social media and blown way out of proportion.\"\r\n\nHe adds, \"You can’t just take pictures of people out for dinner with their family. It’s unethical and a complete invasion of privacy.” Recommend 0 Hopeful Mar 05, 2015 07:10pm Blown out of proportion. I think the problem with Pakistani people is that they don't like the riches. And in general we are a nation who likes to point fingers. Recommend 0 Smot Mar 05, 2015 07:13pm I would never be eating peacefully when my child is crying. Period. Look at the way the baby is hugging the maid, that should have been the mom. Ofcourse to put up the pic on social media and judging the family is absolutely wrong. I'm sure the mom is a good mom,and this is just a random click. Recommend 0 Nasim Mar 05, 2015 07:19pm Its unethical and immoral behaviour on their part. Please take a chill pill. Recommend 0 fawad Mar 05, 2015 07:21pm in the picture there is one empty chair nd two girl and a kid standing out. And looks that the kid was sitting there. Statement of restaurant owner seems wrong.\r\nPeople shouldn't bring maids to restaurant if they can't feed them, or can offer JUST juice while they eat meal. Recommend 0 Riz Mar 05, 2015 07:26pm I think if the story is half narrated then defnitely everyone get the wrong picture. If Alexendre is right and maid was just ask to stand for baby to stop crying then it is fine until she was sat again. But didn't understand the reason for second maid to stand??\r\nI myself have dinner with my brother (driver). Sometime i take him to Bar BQ tonight and sometime at some Dhaba. No body will notice good things about society. Recommend 0 ZackKhan Mar 05, 2015 07:30pm I have been living in USA since 1983, and have been to Pakistan quiet a few times and every time I go my heart bleeds the way my own relative treats their \"servants\". My relative are considered as elite of the society and they go on charities and fund raising dinners, they have also lived in UK for long time and have visited more countries than cities I have to....the point here is when you live in Pakistan you just become heartless and you won't even know what you are doing...narrow thinking and social pressure makes you do things you know is wrong! Recommend 0 Assad Mar 05, 2015 07:35pm Does anybody remember a Child maid was brutally tortured a few days ago in Lahore. Just because you can take picture and share them on Social media does not make you an ambassador for human rights. Recommend 0 lkhan Mar 05, 2015 07:43pm What is most distressing is, the girl maids at the above restaurant themselves are minors, should not be working especially at that hour, instead be with their families at night, and in schools during the day. Alas, this is what most Pakistanis of the so called elite class do not consider, or care about. No empathy for the poverty stricken, indeed more for their pets rather than people, totally blinded to their misery and suffering... Recommend 0 Syed Ahmed, Canada Mar 05, 2015 07:44pm Don't bring the maid servants to restaurant's if you feel ashamed to share the space on the dining table and same food. It is disgusting.

Recommend 0 ayesha Mar 05, 2015 07:46pm Why can't parents take care of their own kids? Why would they bring their maids to a restaurant in the first place so what if the kids will bug for a while...I feel its very cruel to bring them even if you make them sit with you & order food for them, its a life style they can never afford they can never go their with their families so why test their faith. Recommend 0 lkhan Mar 05, 2015 07:47pm By the way, today very few call people in the west address those employed to look after children, homes as maids - the common word is caretaker, or if highly trained, a nanny. Neither the term servant nor maid is much appreciated..... Recommend 0 Nas Mar 05, 2015 07:57pm My friend roaming round in the restaurant is abosultly not Normal, Many people are there to escape th reality No to get bothered by crying child or a house maid pacing up & daown to put the child to sleep....Restaurants should not allow House Maids or they shoul sit with the upper class on the same table Recommend 0 Arsalan Kamal Mar 05, 2015 08:07pm The problem is not whether domestic staff should be seated at the sahib's table or not. The world over it is normal not to have domestic staff at the table. \r\n\nIts an employer/employee relationship.\r\n\nThe problem in our culture is our inability to treat domestic staff as employees. Paying a pittance, employing underage/school age childern, we tend to think of domestic staff as our chattel. They are human beings and need to have their dignity respected but moneyed classes in our society have a long way to go in having confidence in themselves before they will understand this. Recommend 0 femme Mar 05, 2015 08:08pm The poll question is wrong. Do you think people should bring thier domestic staff outside with them. Yes i think they should. The domestic staff needs to get out of the house as well. How they treat them outside is another issue. Recommend 0 Cyrus Ho Mar 05, 2015 08:18pm I am not commenting here. I am listening to your voices. Recommend 0 Iqbal Mar 05, 2015 08:29pm This article seems to side with the family along with restaurant owners. Most of the comments are for or against the family and some are against the person taking picture. \r\n\nThe main issue is the treatment of domestic workers and their rights. Every human being deserve respect regardless of what job they do. If domestic workers are not treated right then the people need to be shamed and exposed (we know that the law does not work in Pakistan so the shaming is probably the only way) . \r\n\nHats of to the person who took this picture and started the debate. Recommend 0 Ali Vazir Mar 05, 2015 08:34pm 1) This is definitely breach of privacy.\r\n2) This is how our society is, discriminatory, but not only ours, majority of the world is like that, in their own way. The recent killings of unarmed blacks at the hands of white policemen in US; denying hearing a woman in Canadian court due to head scarf; insulting Non-Arabs in Saudia; calling a rape victim responsible for the crime (against women); are a few examples. We need to work on our own selves first, demonstrate a good example and then can spread the word.\r\n3) The survey at the bottom has 2 options. There should be the 3rd option \"As they wish\". None of other person's business. Recommend 0 N. Rahim Mar 05, 2015 08:36pm Where is the Pakistani sense of human values gone? Recommend 0 Khalid Mar 05, 2015 09:22pm This is exactly the kind of people we are. I am not surprised at all. We treat servants worse than how slaves were treated in the days of slavery. One of the girls looks like a child herself. The excuse that they were sitting with their \"masters\" a few minutes before the picture was taken is nothing but a lie. Makes me ashamed to belong to the same society. Recommend 0 lafanga Mar 05, 2015 09:31pm A certain segment of South Asian society (Pakistan/India) ONLY wants to have babies BUT not look after them. Going to a restaurant should be a family experience and bonding with the children if they go along. What's the point of having Children if maid is going to look after them 24/7. Recommend 0 Mariam Mar 05, 2015 09:48pm You know what really bothers me? The girl in the black scarf looks to be no more that 14 yrs old. That's child labour. \r\nTo be honest, I have seen quite a few well off families with young boys or girls taking care of their children. They are paid a pittance, with no fixed work hours. What is pathetic is how these people rationalise child labour: 'Atleast we give food and pay or he/she would be out on the road doing god knows what' 'They have no future anyway, atleast we are giving them a job' ' We are actually helping them and giving them a stable life'\r\n\nHonestly, if you really want to 'help' these poor kids, how about sponsoring their education instead? Recommend 0 Sayyar Khan Mar 05, 2015 09:50pm Just a shameful society. I know one thing its not as bad in KPK then compare to rest of the country. Maybe I am wrong but that's what I have noticed. Recommend 0 Masood Haider Mar 05, 2015 09:50pm If a family dining out was seen brutally beating one of the children would that be a private matter? Nowadays, many undesirable actions, such as instances of police brutality are exposed because someone took a picture and posted it on the web. Good way to shame people into behaving properly. Recommend 0 sidra naeem paracha Mar 05, 2015 09:57pm It is not an inciddent, it is a general social action which i see every other time i visit malls or food courts.

Its child lavery, i will not even call it child labour.\r\n3. Will this family, who s sitting enjoying food, will ever ever allow their children to work? No matter what may be the situation? \r\n4. Supporting all this , espchild maids rather child slaves is disgusting , simply unhuman,no logic can justufy this, its wrong morally n religiously. \r\n5.

When the child they were taking care of got fussy they got up to walk around a little to calm him down. In those few minutes,....\", the photo reveals only one chair near the employer for 2 maids and if you pay attention the child doesn't look fussy, please don't hide, that's discriminatory. Recommend 0 Karl Mar 06, 2015 12:25am In restaurants there are High chairs for children not maids, and especially the example at the end of the article which says that a lady asked for a chair for the maid while ordering the food shows again that the maid was standing while alll of the family were seated, tell me please how many of us do that with our own family members or friends, whenever we go to a restaurant we wait until enough chairs are available for everyone to sit not just sit and wait to ask for a chair for a friend or a family member Recommend 0 Saadahgul Khan Mar 06, 2015 12:29am Filthy rich, morally bankrupt. Recommend 0 khyiam Mar 06, 2015 01:18am Well this is just an small incident in the society we live in. We as a society never cared for each other feelings, sentiments or even talk about these issues. And this happing in a society we live shouldn't be cared.\r\n\nAnd yes- Perhaps social media had nothing more to share and dawn news might need some social media exposure by brining up this issue! Recommend 0 fizza Mar 06, 2015 01:25am I simply reject the idea of having a maid to take care of your children. If you can't give them time and can't take care of them, you don't deserve to be a parent. Parenthood doesn't mean spending money on your child, it means taking care of them and giving them proper time and care. Recommend 0 Fauzia Haider Mar 06, 2015 02:06am Not impressed by the article at all. It sounded like a personal rebuttal for the family photographed and not addressing the bigger issue of mistreatment of servants. Which is a fact of life in Pakistan and needs addressing. Recommend 0 NASR Mar 06, 2015 02:56am I think we have to in fact we should give up this pariah like treatment to our domestic servants and share with them every occasion. And this is what is our religious teaching also for which we will be accountable on the Day of Judgement when every soul will be standing equal. Recommend 0 :) Mar 06, 2015 03:21am i agree with SOS, judging people by what they see is our nations desaease, a perseption can be or can not be the actual truth. Its easy to point fingers at others, ppl ate always baised in judging others, instead we should try to see both sides of every coin as our own. Recommend 0 Shaer Khan Mar 06, 2015 03:27am Folks,\r\nThis people are being paid for the job they are performing and thats it. This is business, stop crying about it. These people (servants) may have already been fed at home before they came to the restaurant. Please don't define a book just by looking at the cover of the book, Read it for the God sake. We Pakistanis are so quick to judge others without looking at themselve first. Recommend 0 sundale2 Mar 06, 2015 03:37am There is something to take stock in for the future. The group claims the two maids were in essence calming the child down. True or not, it does highlight the chance of a single picture being used to show something that's totally wrong.\r\n\nWe should be careful to make sure we have the whole story before we cry foul. We may be right or wrong this time, but what about next time? Start the caution now, so that next time, we can be sure we got it right before we do anything. Recommend 0 viva Mar 06, 2015 04:36am First of all Thanks to Dawn for bringing this topic up .And I wish they wont come after DAWN for publishing their photos.. \r\n\"Does social media bring out the worst in us or the best?\" - YES. a social media is really as powerful as a print media to awake the people. A social debate is good and would yield awareness. things like this are also common in India. \r\n\nif what Alexander (hotel manager) said that they actually allowed maid to sit with them then sorry for the family .\r\n\nI am an Indian and I always had my cab drivers/ workers to sit with me when we go to hotels and movies. This I learnt from my family . These kind of things usually learnt with family values only. Recommend 0 Dekh Magar Pyaar Se Mar 06, 2015 04:50am @arshad Did you read the article? Recommend 0 Vijay (Toronto) Mar 06, 2015 04:56am @ZackKhan I watched the movie KPAX a while back. The only dialogue that sticks in my mind from the whole movies is: \"Every child in the UNIVERSE knows right from wrong.\" We South Asians specialise in closing our eyes and brains to crap all around us. And then we visit Mandir/Masjid/Gurudwara/Church and think we have bought off God! Recommend 0 Nizamuddin Ahmad Aali Mar 06, 2015 05:50am What you see, what you get folks. That is our real picture and practice. We treat our servants like children of lesser God. I have seen and know lot ( I mean lot, some 80 % ) of homes where cheaper food is also cooked for maids. This is all over the world. Once while visiting USA with my family ( Laredo, Texas ) I bought meal for a ten years boy who asked for food and looked femish, asked him to eat with my two daughters. The restaurant manager got very upset claiming I was ruining his eatery image and refused to serve us food. We went o a fast food restaurant and eat there, but we were constantly stared at by other customers. Being poor is the biggest crime of all. I should know first hand, I was there once facing daily humiliations not only strangers but from my own well of cousins. I pray to God Almighty that no child or any human being has to face the humiliation when he or she has nothing to the conditions beyond his or her control. Recommend 0 Melbourne Mar 06, 2015 06:17am I agree with Asim Rizvi, Ateast blur the faces and apart from this, this is not ethical to give this in Dawn news to ashame this family on local and International media, now i am wathcing this sitting in Australia??

Is that the name that he gives out? Stick to Sikander Rizvi please, sounds MUCH better and a lot less wannabe! Recommend 0 Aasma Mar 06, 2015 08:35am If you are so eager to eat out and act like you are very much \" civilized \" or \"cultured\" or so called \"westernised\", then you should also believe in human equality. And if you can't afford to buy your servants the same food that you eat then at least leave him or her at home. This attitude is unacceptable,both socially and religiously. Recommend 0 aniqa sultan Mar 06, 2015 08:50am It is not about feeding them what you eat. It is about the class difference and exposing them to something which they cant enjoy , it usually bring to them a feeling of inferiority. I have seen many time family bringing their kids along with maid where maid just take care of kids while the family eat their dinner. It is inhumane and cruel. Recommend 0 Raheel Lakhani Mar 06, 2015 10:03am The ending note is not a funny story. It's downright discriminatory and in bad taste. Recommend 0 lkhan Mar 06, 2015 11:03am @Ali not just to feel good about it. The laws protect domestic workers in many forms and manner. Their daily work hours (not more than 8 hrs with rest periods specified, weekends off), dignified salaries, if live ins, under humane conditions and certainly not sleeping on the floor in the kitchen, their social security payments, and more.. Believe me, from experience I can write,the help at home not only is respected as equals, and treated so, but if not, they are totally aware of their rights and if dragged to courts, employers are duly meted sentences. Judges in Madrid to London to elsewhere take the rights of the weaker very seriously. Two glaring examples are of Noami Campbell in NYC having to pay fines and clean daily for months a community building... Or more recently, the Indian diplomat in NYC...

I have twins, and no matter how much u try, u only have two hands. U cannot take care of two babies at thesame time. Everybody does not hv the luxury of joint family. Its not a status symbol to have a maid, sometimes its a necessity. Having said that, one must always treat domestic help as human beings, and show kindness n respect towards them. Afterall they are our biggest helpers. Recommend 0 Aurangzaib Mar 06, 2015 12:33pm Thats pity and quite common in capitalist class. Recommend 0 IHA Mar 06, 2015 02:55pm I dont get the point of bringing the maids along anyway. Why cant they babysit the kids at home? If you are worried about how they will treat the children then set up a remote camera solution to keep an eye on things. Its pretty cheap and easy nowadays. You can even use your laptop or ipad to act as a remote camera which you can monitor over your smartphone. Unless you absolutely have to show off that you are a begum sahiba with a maid I dont see the point. Recommend 0 mshaiq Mar 06, 2015 03:05pm I think a point we here in Pakistan need to be reminded of is that maids/drivers/domestic staff/help are your EMPLOYEES. They are NOT your SLAVES to be bent to your every wish. They are human beings EXACTLY like you with desires, hopes, dreams and self-respect. \r\n\nIf you mess up at your office, your boss won't slap you, or throw you off the balcony. He'll fire you. You'll lose your job. That's as far as he/she can go.\r\n\nYou pay for their services, not their life. Have some respect and put your expensive education to some use. Recommend 0 Muhammad Saad Khan Mar 06, 2015 03:20pm I personally count this act as a crime. I seriously don't understand that a person who gets an education not only at school but at home could do this. Where are our hearts gone? Don't we really have the fear that it may come to us as well? If you have money in your pockets, this doesn't mean that you can treat people like a servant. These are kids damn it. Flowers. They are not your slaves. Did we get this country to make our own people our slaves? Do we even know the word \"Empathy\"? This raised a lot of questions in my mind. \r\n\nI have been taught by my parents that whatever you do with others...good or bad. It will come back to you some day in the same way. This preaching never let me do injustice to anyone in my whole life.\r\n\nAnd I swear I have seen people who have been suffering the way they did to the others. \r\n\nThis made me question the word \"Human\". Are we? Recommend 0 Saquib Mar 06, 2015 04:23pm If it's proven that the picture was taken out of context than will the person who posted the image come forward and apologize?
