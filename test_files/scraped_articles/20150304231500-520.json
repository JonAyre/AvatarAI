{"content":" Letter: Union power created workers' rights Letter: Union power created workers' rights Letters to the editor |  Wisconsin EDITOR: Regarding Wisconsin's moves toward becoming a right-to-work state, I believe it should be noted that proceeding with this agenda will severely damage the rights that have been fought for and earned over the years by union members. The following is a list of some of the benefits union members have helped to secure for all workers, union and non-union. After reading this list, ask yourself, how many of these did you fight for? Weekends without work; breaks at work, including lunch breaks; paid vacation; Family and Medical Leave Act; sick leave; Social Security; minimum wage; the Civil Rights Act, which in Title Vll prohibits employer discrimination; the eight-hour work day; overtime pay; child labor laws; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the 40-hour work week; workers compensation; unemployment insurance; pensions; workplace safety standards and regulations; employer health care insurance; collective bargaining rights for employees; wrongful termination laws; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967; whistleblower protection laws; the Employee Polygraph Protection Act, which prohibits employers from using a lie detector test on an employee; Veteran's Employment and Training Services; compensation increases and evaluations; sexual harassment laws; the Americans With Disabilities Act; holiday pay; employer dental, life and vision insurance; privacy rights; privacy and parental leave; military leave; the right to strike; public education for children; the Equal Pay Acts of 1963 and 2011, which require employers pay men and women equally for the same amount of work; laws ending sweatshops in the U.S. You do not enjoy these benefits due to the good nature of big business but due to the hard work and sacrifice of union workers. If Wisconsin becomes a right-to-work state, all of these wages and benefits will be jeopardized. In our next election, you might consider voting for the Democrats, who will hopefully put an end to the controversy we now face in Wisconsin.
