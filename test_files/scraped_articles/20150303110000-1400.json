Christian Children?s Fund of Canada The Christian Children?s Fund of Canada (CCFC), a child centred NGO, supported the TKDA with an amount of GH?112,245 for the training, which benefited some 140 people making up of 112 girls and 28 boys. The NGO also supported all the beneficiaries with small business-start-up items, and linked them up to some financial institutions, government agencies and business service providers, to ensure that they start their own businesses, as means of helping end early marriages, and to prevent them from migrating to the cities for non-existent jobs. Reverend Mrs Sanatu Nantogma, Tuma Kavi programme leader, speaking at a ceremony to graduate some of the trainees at Yong, a community in the Savelugu/Nanton Municipality, stressed the need for the training to end the rampant forced and early marriages in the area. She said TKDA was working to improve the living standards of the vulnerable in society, and that the NGO?s areas of focus were child sponsorship to implement initiatives such as health and nutrition, education, micro-enterprise development, agro-forestry, food security, and water and sanitation. She said field experience had showed that lack of sustainability in some vocational programmes in the past increased child poverty, which left the youth without any form of earning income, which leads to early or forced marriages and sometimes migration to the south, for menial jobs, hence the need to organize the training for the youth. She said Tuma Kavi had also moved beyond the traditional skills training such as sewing, carpentry, and masonry, among others, to provide market relevant training skills, and support initiatives that take shorter periods to complete. Rev. Mrs Nantogma thanked the CCFC and the Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI), for the support, and gave the assurance that Tuma Kavi would always embark on programmes and projects to better the lives of the people especially those in rural and vulnerable communities. Mr William Anim Dankwa, Public Relations Officer (PRO) of CCFC, explained that CCFC?s approach towards development was to work through local partners, local NGOs, community-based organizations and government institutions. He said, CCFC over the years, had worked with partners in the Northern Region, to salvage the vulnerable from excruciating suffering, and gave the assurance that it would continue supporting its partners to work to improve the living conditions of people. He said poverty was a key driver of child labour, which had allowed some parents to condone with their daughters to become sexually active at early stages of their lives, and that some 45.1 per cent of the children in the Northern Region had been victims of early and forced marriages. Mr Dankwa said the skills training and education to end child and early forced marriages in the Savelugu/Nanton Municipality sought to equip the 140 out-of-school teenage girls and boys, with market-driven vocational and enterprise development skills.
