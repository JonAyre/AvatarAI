Describing the 16.7 million figure of child labour as a conservative estimate, the report released here said what is more distressing is that one in five of these children are aged 11 or under. While India accounts for the highest number of child labourers in the region, Bangladesh accounts for 5 million, Pakistan for 3.4 million and Nepal for 2 million. However, in relative terms, children in Nepal face the highest risk of being in child labour, with more than a quarter of 5-17 year-olds in the country engaged in child labour. The report, \"Measuring children's work in South Asia: Perspectives from national household surveys\" brings to fore that besides working on hazardous jobs, other worse forms of child labour including debt bondage, children in armed conflict, sexual exploitation and domestic child labour also exists in the region. The first ILO South Asia report on child labour and children's employment is based on data compiled from 2005-06 to 2011-12 fiscal years based on information gathered through national household surveys in seven South Asian countries, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, the Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. It provides an overview of child labour, children in employment and educational marginalization in the South Asian region. The report found agriculture absorbs the highest percentage of children in employment - ranging from 46 per cent in Bangladesh to 94 per cent in Nepal. Out-of-school children are a \"formidable challenge\" in the South Asia region, the report stresses highlighting that an estimated 24 million under-14 children in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh alone are neither in school or in employment. \"Millions of children across South Asia are trapped in child labour and millions more are missing from education, so the need for a massive and sustained response is urgent and critical,\" said Sherin Khan, Senior Child Labour Specialist at the ILO's Decent Work Team for South Asia. \"The report points to multiple child labour hotspots that must be addressed urgently, by integrating action against child labour into a much wider range of policies, action and reporting systems.\" The report recommends reinforcing efforts to incorporate child labour issues into social welfare and protection programmes, increasing public spending on basic education for both girls and boys, and more research into the relationship between work and school. \"The report is a wake-up call, reminding us that addressing child labour must be an urgent priority,\" said Corinne Vargha, Chief of ILO's Fundamental Labour Rights Programme. \"While there has been decline in the number of child labourers globally, most markedly in Asia and the Pacific, the magnitude of the problem in South Asia in particular, is of great concern.\" NEW DELHI - In a wake-up call, a new International Labour Organisation report Tuesday highlighted that 5.8 million of almost 17 million children between five and 17 found to be engaged in child labour in South Asia are in India.
