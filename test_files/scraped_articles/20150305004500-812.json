Munusamy has issued a notification in the District Gazette, and is all set to send a proposal to the government to accord the child labour-free status to the district. “Sivaganga has emerged as the first district in the State to fulfil all the guidelines and criteria prescribed by the Labour Department in the Government Order issued in 2007 to become eligible for child labour-free status,” S.P. Shanthi, Inspector of Labour, said on Wednesday. After going through the 2,000-page report, submitted by her department, detailing the steps taken to fulfil the guidelines and achieve the action plan, the Collector issued the notification in the District Gazette on February 25, she said. The Collector would send a proposal to the Commissioner of Labour on completion of the action plan and urge the government to accord the child labour-free status to the district by issuing a notification in the Government Gazette.
