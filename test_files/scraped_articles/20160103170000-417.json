It's called We Day, an international event from Free the Children, the charitable organization headed up by Craig and Marc Kielburger. Craig gained international recognition nearly two decades ago as a 10-year-old child who vowed to make a difference after seeing child labour conditions in India and some Third World countries. It ultimately led to the formation of Free the Children and in turn, has led to another exciting arm of service and this is what has attracted the Hillcrest Grade 7s and their teacher Cat Costa. \"You don't buy tickets to We Day, you earn them,\" said Brenna Lawrence, one of a group of girls who took time out from a can and bottle recycling fundraising project after school to talk about what they're up to. We Day challenges young citizens to become agents of change or as Costa put it, \"learn how to become leaders.\" The We Day challenge the class has set for themselves has taken several forms so far as they move closer to their goal of raising $6,500 which should be enough to get this class of 23 on a chartered bus for Saskatoon. The lessons the students have learned in preparing for the trip have value too, since they are planning, budgeting and even have a Plan B in the event they can't raise enough funds for accommodation. They've been invited to bunk down in an elementary school gymnasium in Saskatoon if their fundraising falls a little short. On Jan. 23, they had raised $4,100 thanks in large part to a $3,300 grant from Southeast Connections, which is to be used for transportation costs. The rest has been raised through bake sales (kids and moms) at the Estevan Shoppers Mall each Saturday, the sale of homemade book bags and income from SARCAN through the recycling effort. They have also engaged in a silent auction, sold some crochet items and did physical work for donations. \"After the last snowstorm, one of our guys stuffed the mailboxes of the houses around his neighbourhood, offering to shovel for a donation. He came to school on Monday with $75,\" said Costa. \"We've managed to sell a whole bunch of goodies,\" said student Morgan Barnard. Once they get to Saskatoon, the class will be inundated with motivational messages, concrete plans as to how they can make a difference as future leaders, volunteers, business managers and responsible environmental watchdogs. To earn a ticket to the event, they must show how they've contributed both on a local volunteer level as well as making a positive contribution to the protection of the environment. \"They've taken it beyond a We Day challenge,\" said Costa, pointing to events the class is planning well past February. The students have added a photography element to their drive (printed and framed) for their silent auction and a penny collection drive to Adopt a Village project in South America or Africa. The can and bottle recycling, Can for a Cause, came with a social conscience. \"We realized the Salvation Army did food drives, so we went to food stores and churches and they gave us cans and we've delivered 641 cans of stuff for them,\" said Brenna. So that becomes part of their local project mandate. The global element came from a New Year's resolution to reduce each student's carbon footprint. This is illustrated in the front foyer of the school with each student's footprint outlined on a crafted globe. They've learned about the importance of carefully using non-renewable resources. The school population will be put to a test on Earth Day in April and they're focused on reducing air pollution with green-based resolutions and reminder posters put up around the school. \"Turning off electronic equipment, turning off the lights, it helps,\" said Rhegan Badley. \"One of the spinoffs that has occurred as a result of their awareness is a project to make dog biscuits for the humane society,\" Costa said. \"Organic biscuits,\" she added with a chuckle. The class has partnered with the Royal Bank on the penny collection side, arranging to bring in the pennies in loose form as long as they are in $25 lots. RBC is also a major sponsor of the Saskatchewan We Day, along with Telus and Potash Corp. Social media classes have been boosted as a result of this student awareness, said their instructor. While the youngsters and their parents have been baking, selling, collecting, sorting, recycling and reducing carbon footprints, their energy and enthusiasm has caught the attention of others such as the Estevan University Women's Club and the Bikers Against Diabetes who have an affiliation with a couple of the kids, having supported them at a summer camp in the past. \"The school's community council is lending their support. \"I think they can feel the vibration throughout the school about this project,\" said Costa who came to Estevan this year from a former school in Warman, another one of Saskatchewan's fast-growing cities. Estevan has impressed her. \"I'm overwhelmed at how fast this community has responded. The kids have done the footwork and the city is responding,\" she said. Asked what they've learned from this experiment outside of the obvious opportunity to attend We Day, the students such as Jessica Shebaglo-Lajoie and Nikiela Grulich, along with Morgan, Rhegan and Brenna are quick to respond. \"We've learned power of numbers,\" they said separately and then repeated in near unison. \"As a collective, we have power to make changes ... social justice or environmental,\" a couple of them added. \"The lessons are Education Ministry driven initiatives, how and what you can show me you've done,\" Costa added. One student quietly reflected on the fact she had noticed some interesting things about fellow classmates ... how some were boldly stepping up, others quietly contributing while others were at a \"go with the flow,\" level. They are all contributing because that's one of the deal-breakers. They're all in, or none are in. All can contribute according to their interests and abilities. There's no judgment, just a class desire to get to Saskatoon and get pumped up to do even more good things. The fact that in the past, We Day has included appearances from such luminaries as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Dalai Lama, Jane Goodall, Shaquille O'Neal, Romeo Dallaire, Jennifer Hudson, Justin Bieber, Sarah McLachlin or One Republic, hints at what they might expect in Saskatoon. The guest presenters are purposely kept out of the We Day promotions so that students will focus on the main purpose and not on \"who we might get to see.\" \"I've seen the energy grow. They're taking over on this project. They're there,\" Costa said in conclusion. See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?
