Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Advertisement The TPP will damage far more than our medicine prices (\"Trade deal's bitter pills\", 3/3). This \"NAFTA on steroids\" is less about free trade than about giving corporations power over national governments' laws and regulations. It has been largely written in secret by multinationals with their interests at heart. No longer will we be able to refuse products that don't adhere to our environmental regulations (\"dolphin safe\", chemical use, certification labels), child labour laws, health regulations (cigarette plain packaging, food labelling) and a range of protections we take for granted. Under the TPP, a tribunal comprising lawyers from the corporate giants will be set up to rule on such matters. If we disagree, we will be slapped with sanctions. Any changes to the TPP need agreement by all countries. It is the most insidious, regressive, undemocratic agreement yet penned. It should not be signed. David Blair, Healesville Illustration: Michael Leunig Ratification just a formality Mr Robb's claims that \"the TPP text will not be kept secret. Once it is agreed between participants, it will be made public and also subjected to parliamentary scrutiny prior to any final ratification\" are weasel words. The process is that Cabinet authorises the final negotiated text to be signed before it is publicly released. It is then reviewed by a parliamentary committee, but the text cannot be changed. Parliament only votes on the implementing legislation, not the whole text. This means large parts of the text not requiring legislation – such as foreign investor rights to sue governments (ISDS) and any restrictions on future legislation – are not debated or approved by Parliament. Ratification only comes at the end of this process, after the legislation, and is just a formal exchange of letters before the agreement comes into force. If we want any meaningful public debate of the final text, it must be released before Cabinet decides to sign it. Patricia Ranald, Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network We need IP protection Critics of the TPP trade negotiations, particularly in relation to intellectual property provisions and medicines, have raised concerns that don't tell the complete story. In Australia, we have scientists, clinicians and some great companies working to help develop the newest medicines. But we lack sufficient commercial investment and a globally competitive intellectual property (IP) regime to help protect the work. I sit on a number of biotech boards and the key question that always arises relates to the strength of IP in relation to a new therapy. IP is at the core of any life sciences company valuation, and as such, the period of the patent and/or the data exclusivity is of paramount importance when we assess which companies or projects we will invest in. Enhanced IP protection for medicines is not a choice between cheap drugs and enriching pharmaceutical firms. It is a choice between helping Australia to be a leader in the next scientific revolution or waiting and hoping someone else will do the job. Dr George Morstyn, Brighton Advertisement Robb's claims eerily familiar Mr Robb says \"I am not going to do something that I think is not in the public interest\". This comforting statement sounds eerily like other meaningless promises from this government – the PM's promise to govern for all Australians, Joe Hockey's to produce an even-handed budget and Christopher Pyne's \"improvements\" to tertiary education. At least these policies had to be vetted by the Senate, where many have quite rightly run into a brick wall. So Mr Robb's view of what is in the public interest may differ dramatically from the rest of us. Public, independent scrutiny is necessary before we are locked into this agreement. Peter Thomson, Richmond Negative role models Your editorial (\"Rethink draconian approaches to justice\", 2/3) is timely. The state's prison population is expected to reach 7169 in June – up from 4350 in June 2009, with the bulk of the increase since 2011. The former government's \"tough on crime\" legislation will push these numbers even higher. A new men's prison, Ravenhall, will open in 2017 with a capacity of 1000 prisoners. How the system will cope until then is beyond me – our prisons have been overcrowded for years. Another 1000-bed prison should be on the drawing board, and another after that. Construction costs will be massive as will be incarceration costs (approaching $100,000 per prisoner per year). And still no appreciable reduction in the crime rate. With rare exceptions, every prisoner is eventually released (average sentence 3.3 years). They are often young – in their 20s and 30s. Many will return to the community with no permanent accommodation, poor (or non-existent) job prospects, new \"friends\" we'd rather they hadn't met, fractured family relationships and a view of the world coloured by their penal experience. The recidivism rate is rising – perhaps no surprise with prisons bursting at the seams and resources overstretched. This is the harvest we will reap in even greater measure if the current approach is maintained. Surely we can do better? Michael Strong, County Court judge 1988 – 2008 Poor logic, Mr Hockey Treasurer Joe Hockey argues against a crackdown on multinational tax avoidance saying it will threaten jobs as companies would reduce their Australian operations (The Age, 3/3). To follow this logic through, we should be boosting employment by encouraging further hemorrhaging of government revenue with an expansion of tax avoidance and evasion. Alternatively, if we want to have multinationals sharing the tax load then we should show companies like Apple, News Corp, Westfield and Google the door and say, \"stay and contribute or leave and stop being a parasite on our country\". Peter Allan, West Brunswick On margins of society I wonder how concerned our leaders are about teenagers' despondency about their future – unlikely to ever own their own home, facing a poor job market, and a tertiary education increasingly the preserve of the rich. If the average teenager feels this level of concern, no wonder those who may find school less stimulating or who through religion or ethnicity find themselves on society's margins are fodder for those who seek to do us harm. Sadly our leaders are preoccupied with headline-grabbing \"war on terrorism\" actions, wasting billions on pointless distant military posturing, and maintaining regular, self-defeating paranoia at home. The real war against terrorism should be to work to recreate a society where there is full employment, housing is affordable and the vast wealth of the rich and the multinationals is taxed fairly. Martin Dix, Healesville Voters must have voice Roger Wolfe (Letters, 2/3), to label a group of talented individuals who have been elected by potentially tens of thousands of citizens as merely \"reserves\" is insulting and essentially denies their constituents a voice in one of the nation's most important questions. Second, if the front bench was to be tasked with selecting the leader we would be left with the farcical situation of the leader picking the front bench, and the front bench picking the leader. Nathan Brumley, Mount Martha Too many sporting ties I have often thought that Australians tend to choose their political allegiances in much the same way they choose their sporting teams – pick a team and then barrack like mad regardless of how they perform. Loyalty to your team is paramount. So it should come as no surprise when the operation of our political system is described as analogous to our sporting teams. But back benchers are not the reserves. They are not picked from a draft by a board. They are the members that we, the community, have elected to represent us in the decision-making body called Parliament. They in turn elect those members they feel will best lead the decision making on behalf of the community. If those representatives believe the leader is not performing the role as intended, they have a responsibility to the community they represent to either insist on improvement or make them stand aside. Patricia Casey, Ringwood North When ethics run distant second to greed On rising anti-Semitism (Comment, 2/3), the most extensive study of the Gentiles who saved Jews from the Holocaust isolated one core factor: the strong values rescuers had learnt growing up. Aristotle recognised that \"moral excellence comes about as a result of habit\". The ancient Greeks understood that integrity develops in individuals only by personal effort and in societies by sustained communal striving. Yet, neo-conservative free-market ideology, which has already delivered two world wars and the Depression, jettisons the common good and promotes individual gain as the greatest virtue. Ruthlessness, greed and dishonesty pay the biggest dividends, extinguishing ethics from the top down. In Plato's words, this puts a lie in people's souls. The life-protecting forces of conscience, empathy, fairness, compassion and respect become quaint anachronisms. People who live ethically finish last in a morally bankrupt society. Rising anti-Semitism and other violence evoke the canary in the coal-mine alarm. It is consistent with the dearth of leadership, from workplaces to the world stage, that champions and rewards ethical values. Barbara Chapman, Hawthorn Banks behaving badly After more than 20 years as a loyal National Australia Bank customer, I have decided to move my accounts after reading about the scandal at NAB (\"Scandal reveals shortcomings\", 2/3). Can any one advise me whether the Commonwealth Bank would be a suitable place to transfer my accounts to? James Meehan, Malvern East Gonski ideal betrayed Legislation passed last week in Victoria links state funding of private schools to public school costs regardless of how wealthy the private school. The government has betrayed the basic principle of the Gonski funding model – that future increases in government funding for private schools should be determined by actual need. Instead, the government has legislated to ensure that funding increases for public schools will automatically flow on in part to private schools. The move is in sharp contrast to that of the NSW government, which repealed the link between state government funding of private schools and public school costs and replaced it with a needs-based funding system. So much for equity. Dr David Zyngier, faculty of education, Monash University Paths to nowhere Telling bike riders to use only recreational paths is like telling drivers to go to a race track: it seems like a good idea except the paths don't take you where you need to go (Letters, 3/3). Like race tracks, bike paths are not designed for large volumes of traffic. Paths are often badly maintained, narrow, crowded with pedestrians, disjointed and interrupted by roads. Instead of endless complaints about bikes on the roads how about this: narrow the car lanes, reduce traffic speed (doesn't research show that slowing traffic speeds up travel times?), educate all road users (including police) about road laws and the vulnerability of bikes, do everything to calm traffic, and remember that paved roads were originally built for bicycles: cars are the interlopers. Mark Minchinton, West Footscray Run graphic campaign Again, another young life lost through momentary thoughtlessness (\"Tears flow for life taken\", 3/3). Why not run a graphic poster campaign at all service stations as we wait for our petrol tanks to fill. Hopefully, a subconscious reminder will remain as we drive back into traffic or prepare to park. A tragedy that changes lives forever could be averted. Betty Dixon, Yarra Junction Create door sticker In memory of Alberto Paulon and James Cross, could some creative soul please design a sticker for all motorists to apply to the inside of their car door to remind them to look out for cyclists? Rosemary Nixon, Ivanhoe East Mooted truck numbers The expansion of the Webb Dock precinct by 2025 is expected to result in a total of 6000 truck movements, up from more than 3000 currently, not an extra 6000 (\"Truck 'nightmare' looms for West Gate\", 27/2). Nick Easy, CEO, Port of Melbourne Corporation AND ANOTHER THING... Politics A \"free\" trade agreement? To give overseas companies \"free\" control of critical aspects of the government of our country? Diana Snape, Balwyn Are ministers and bureaucrats who sign trade deals that compromise or destroy our sovereignty guilty of treason? Graeme Madigan, Brighton So, big business sending billions of dollars overseas protects Australian employment? What a novel idea. Adrian Peniston-Bird, Hawthorn Mr Abbott is polling poorly, so more young Australians will be sent to risk their lives in Iraq. Ian Bell, Fitzroy Another broken promise from a government that assured us there would be no \"mission creep\". Malcolm Fraser, Oakleigh South It appears government critics in Russia are disposed of by bullets; here the \"trigger\" is a volley of words. Keith Murley, Blairgowrie Other matters What's the value of a human life? Currently, $369 (\"Tougher penalties for dooring rejected\", 3/3). As long as this is the case, driver behaviour will not change. Benjamin Levy, St Kilda East In the midst of an \"obesity epidemic\", shouldn't the MCG and Etihad be increasing the prices of a pie and chips? Low-cost \"healthier\" alternatives would be more appropriate. Joanne Dietrich, Oak Park Now you can get a lot fatter for a little less. Ian Hetherington, Moama, NSW With a report showing some women work for 2004 wages, has the MCG targeted them by cutting food prices to 2001 levels? Bryan Fraser, St Kilda Holden's new slogan is \"Let's Go There\". I wish the choice had been \"Let's Stay Here\". Matthew Gilbert, Hampton Park Twice in two days.

Patricia Casey, Ringwood North On rising anti-Semitism (Comment, 2/3), the most extensive study of the Gentiles who saved Jews from the Holocaust isolated one core factor: the strong values rescuers had learnt growing up. Aristotle recognised that \"moral excellence comes about as a result of habit\". The ancient Greeks understood that integrity develops in individuals only by personal effort and in societies by sustained communal striving. Yet, neo-conservative free-market ideology, which has already delivered two world wars and the Depression, jettisons the common good and promotes individual gain as the greatest virtue. Ruthlessness, greed and dishonesty pay the biggest dividends, extinguishing ethics from the top down. In Plato's words, this puts a lie in people's souls. The life-protecting forces of conscience, empathy, fairness, compassion and respect become quaint anachronisms. People who live ethically finish last in a morally bankrupt society. Rising anti-Semitism and other violence evoke the canary in the coal-mine alarm. It is consistent with the dearth of leadership, from workplaces to the world stage, that champions and rewards ethical values. Barbara Chapman, Hawthorn After more than 20 years as a loyal National Australia Bank customer, I have decided to move my accounts after reading about the scandal at NAB (\"Scandal reveals shortcomings\", 2/3). Can any one advise me whether the Commonwealth Bank would be a suitable place to transfer my accounts to? James Meehan, Malvern East Legislation passed last week in Victoria links state funding of private schools to public school costs regardless of how wealthy the private school. The government has betrayed the basic principle of the Gonski funding model – that future increases in government funding for private schools should be determined by actual need. Instead, the government has legislated to ensure that funding increases for public schools will automatically flow on in part to private schools. The move is in sharp contrast to that of the NSW government, which repealed the link between state government funding of private schools and public school costs and replaced it with a needs-based funding system. So much for equity. Dr David Zyngier, faculty of education, Monash University Telling bike riders to use only recreational paths is like telling drivers to go to a race track: it seems like a good idea except the paths don't take you where you need to go (Letters, 3/3). Like race tracks, bike paths are not designed for large volumes of traffic. Paths are often badly maintained, narrow, crowded with pedestrians, disjointed and interrupted by roads. Instead of endless complaints about bikes on the roads how about this: narrow the car lanes, reduce traffic speed (doesn't research show that slowing traffic speeds up travel times?), educate all road users (including police) about road laws and the vulnerability of bikes, do everything to calm traffic, and remember that paved roads were originally built for bicycles: cars are the interlopers. Mark Minchinton, West Footscray Again, another young life lost through momentary thoughtlessness (\"Tears flow for life taken\", 3/3). Why not run a graphic poster campaign at all service stations as we wait for our petrol tanks to fill. Hopefully, a subconscious reminder will remain as we drive back into traffic or prepare to park. A tragedy that changes lives forever could be averted. Betty Dixon, Yarra Junction In memory of Alberto Paulon and James Cross, could some creative soul please design a sticker for all motorists to apply to the inside of their car door to remind them to look out for cyclists? Rosemary Nixon, Ivanhoe East The expansion of the Webb Dock precinct by 2025 is expected to result in a total of 6000 truck movements, up from more than 3000 currently, not an extra 6000 (\"Truck 'nightmare' looms for West Gate\", 27/2). Nick Easy, CEO, Port of Melbourne Corporation A \"free\" trade agreement? To give overseas companies \"free\" control of critical aspects of the government of our country? Diana Snape, Balwyn Are ministers and bureaucrats who sign trade deals that compromise or destroy our sovereignty guilty of treason? Graeme Madigan, Brighton So, big business sending billions of dollars overseas protects Australian employment? What a novel idea. Adrian Peniston-Bird, Hawthorn Mr Abbott is polling poorly, so more young Australians will be sent to risk their lives in Iraq. Ian Bell, Fitzroy Another broken promise from a government that assured us there would be no \"mission creep\". Malcolm Fraser, Oakleigh South It appears government critics in Russia are disposed of by bullets; here the \"trigger\" is a volley of words. Keith Murley, Blairgowrie What's the value of a human life? Currently, $369 (\"Tougher penalties for dooring rejected\", 3/3). As long as this is the case, driver behaviour will not change. Benjamin Levy, St Kilda East In the midst of an \"obesity epidemic\", shouldn't the MCG and Etihad be increasing the prices of a pie and chips? Low-cost \"healthier\" alternatives would be more appropriate. Joanne Dietrich, Oak Park Now you can get a lot fatter for a little less. Ian Hetherington, Moama, NSW With a report showing some women work for 2004 wages, has the MCG targeted them by cutting food prices to 2001 levels? Bryan Fraser, St Kilda Holden's new slogan is \"Let's Go There\". I wish the choice had been \"Let's Stay Here\". Matthew Gilbert, Hampton Park Twice in two days. Stop changing loop trains to run direct to Flinders Street and dumping hundreds of passengers at Richmond. Are we customers or cattle?
