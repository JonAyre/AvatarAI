As a responsible business, we want to know the rights of these individuals \u2013 and their communities \u2013 are respected and promoted. That\u2019s why we work to unite our global ecosystem of partners around a common ambition to conduct business lawfully, promote human rights, and protect and regenerate nature. In 2023, 85% of our spend was with suppliers meeting Responsible Partner Policy (RPP) requirements, up from 76% in 2022. In 2023, 85% of our spend was with suppliers meeting Responsible Partner Policy (RPP) requirements, up from 76% in 2022. The success of our business relies on many thousands of partners who supply our goods and services and distribute and sell our products \u2013 and our commitment to sustainable growth means we need to be selective in who we work with. Respect for human rights underpins all of Unilever\u2019s Compass goals (PDF 501.03 KB) and we are committed to using our scale and reach for good by insisting on business practices that are responsible, transparent and sustainable so we can grow our business and fulfil our purpose to make sustainable living commonplace. \u20ac43 billion Our spend on goods and services in 2022 Our partner ecosystem of suppliers includes multinational companies, start-ups and small local producers alike. In 2022, our supply chain (PDF 1.83 MB) alone included around 52,000 suppliers in 155 countries.\u00a0Similarly, our sales and distribution network includes a mix of distributors, major retailers, small stores, entrepreneurs and sales agents. By uniting our partners and committing to Partner with Purpose , we can use our collective scale and influence to promote human rights and protect and regenerate nature. To meaningfully promote human rights, we must work to improve the health of the planet; improve people\u2019s health, confidence and wellbeing; and contribute to a fairer and more socially inclusive world. To achieve this, through the Unilever Compass we\u2019ve set ambitious goals for the positive social, environmental and economic change we want to achieve. These include raising living standards , taking positive climate action , promoting diverse suppliers and insisting on practices that embody business integrity and ethics. Our ambitions can only be achieved by working together with others in our value chain. Through our many suppliers \u2013 who provide us with goods and services such as raw materials, logistics, advertising, professional services and much more \u2013 we are innovating, driving mutual growth, and seeking to influence widespread change for people and planet. Ensure compliance with our Responsible Partner Policy. Doing business responsibly is the right thing to do, and it\u2019s central to our Unilever Compass (PDF 501.03 KB) beliefs that companies with purpose last and brands with purpose grow. By choosing to work with partners who commit to conducting business lawfully and with integrity, to respecting human rights, to keeping the people behind our products safe and to caring for our environment, we aim to strengthen our supply chain and promote the mutual growth of our businesses by mitigating risk and, most importantly, working towards fair livelihoods for workers throughout our value chain. Part of growing responsibly is making sure all Unilever partners work in line with our standards around responsible sourcing. To help manage our partner choices, we introduced our Responsible Partner Policy (RPP) in December 2022. Our partner requirements Our Responsible Partner Policy (PDF 4.45 MB) brings together and replaces the supplier-facing Responsible Sourcing Policy (RSP) that we\u2019ve had in place since 2014 and the distributor and customer-facing Responsible Business Partner Policy (RBPP) we introduced in 2017. Five years on from our 2017 revision of the RSP, our new RPP details what we expect of our partners through 17 Fundamental Principles, which are organised into three interconnected pillars: Human Rights, Business Integrity & Ethics, and Planet. It also defines the Mandatory Requirements, Mandatory Management Systems and Future Mandatory Requirements that partners must meet \u2013 or exceed \u2013 to do business with us.

Updated to meet today\u2019s needs The RPP sets the standard for both our Responsible Sourcing Programme and our Responsible Business Partner Programme. It outlines our commitment to responsible business and covers every partner we engage with from packaging, goods and raw material suppliers, to service providers such as creative and media agencies, and our distributors and customers. The terms of our RPP reflect the evolving demands of society and our planet. They address, for example, the increasing need to safeguard data privacy, acknowledge economic sanctions, and progress towards our commitments to living wages, non-animal testing, net zero emissions, and plastic and waste reduction.

A single, comprehensive policy Our RPP\u2019s 17 Fundamental Principles include updated versions of the 12 Fundamental Principles of our previous Responsible Sourcing and Responsible Business Partner Policies, as well as other existing requirements that Unilever has previously presented across different policies, requirements and contractual terms. With the RPP, everything is now in one place. Compliance with our Responsible Sourcing Programme and Responsible Business Partner Programme is assessed against the terms of our Responsible Sourcing Policy and Responsible Business Partner Policy respectively until the end of 2022 and against our new Responsible Partner Policy from 2023 onwards.

Any business that wants to work with us must first confirm they can meet \u2013 or exceed \u2013 the requirements of our RPP. We respect internationally recognised human rights in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and we are embedding them throughout our business. Accordingly, we base our human rights commitments in the Fundamental Principles of the RPP on the International Bill of Human Rights (consisting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), the International Labour Organization\u2019s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and we support the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. 4.

Our Unilever Sustainable Agriculture Code (PDF 7.88 MB) and our People & Nature Policy (PDF 2.04 MB) offer further details and guidance on how our raw material suppliers can fulfil certain RPP Mandatory Requirements. Our Responsible Sourcing Programme and Responsible Business Partner Programme govern the implementation of our RPP\u2019s 17 Fundamental Principles and its Mandatory Requirements, Mandatory Management Systems and Future Mandatory Requirements. Our Responsible Sourcing Programme focuses on our suppliers, while our Responsible Business Partner Programme focuses on the partners who bring our products to consumers \u2013 our customer and distribution network. Through these programmes, we gather insight into our partners\u2019 business practices, gain positive assurance from our partners of their ability to meet the requirements of the RPP, conduct due diligence, evaluate any risks we are exposed to and, where necessary, validate our partners\u2019 alignment with the RPP using appropriate auditing tools. Our aim in including a responsible sourcing goal in the Unilever Compass is to ensure that the Responsible Sourcing Programme is part of our everyday ways of working and builds a positive impact throughout our supply chain. That means 100% compliance with the Responsible Sourcing Programme for all our suppliers, whichever part of our business they supply. To capture this, we\u2019ve increased the scope of our reporting against this Compass goal to include all our existing businesses, as well as newly acquired businesses. We employ a \u2018mutual recognition\u2019 approach, which means recognising suppliers who have their own mature, comprehensive compliance and responsible sourcing programmes in place. For this reason, we do not expect our partners to \u2018sign up\u2019 to our RPP, or adopt our policies, but instead to confirm they can \u2013 and do \u2013 meet or exceed the RPP\u2019s Mandatory Requirements and Mandatory Management Systems through the application of their own policies and practices and, where necessary, validate these with industry-recognised auditing methodologies. This approach aims to reduce the complexity of auditing and increase its impact. Importantly, we also require that our partners cascade equivalent requirements within their own supply chains. By doing this, we hope to inspire industry-wide change to respect human rights, improve wellbeing for people, and protect and regenerate nature. We want respect for human rights to underpin every business decision. That means sourcing from suppliers and working with business partners who adhere to our values. We verify RPP alignment through self-declarations upon registration and annual re-registration to our systems, routine due diligence and risk-based audits. We will enforce our commitment to these requirements by preferentially issuing purchase orders to suppliers who first meet \u2013 and remain compliant to \u2013 our requirements, as per our RSP First approach . We frequently monitor the issues we see as most critical for the future, such as those we\u2019ve set out in our Unilever Compass goals, including climate and living wages . The insights we gather help to inform our Future Mandatory Requirements, which offer our suppliers foresight of our impending requirements and, importantly, gives them time to prepare for them. Our Future Mandatory Requirements are published on our Becoming a Unilever Supplier page. We take a continuous improvement approach to our risk assessment too and undertake regular risk-mapping so we can accurately identify where specific risks occur across geographies and within different supplier types. This leads to more targeted due diligence and auditing for the goods and services we source and ensures we know where to act to drive change if issues arise. To reduce the burden of compliance on suppliers, we encourage the use of industry-accepted auditing systems so suppliers can use one audit to address the needs of multiple customers. Sedex is the largest platform for sharing responsible sourcing data and we use Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) for on-site audits. Where desktop assessments are more appropriate, we use EcoVadis to evaluate suppliers. Our Responsible Sourcing Programme Audit Requirements (PDF 115.67 KB) set out the details of what we expect when validation is required. Human Rights Progress Report 2021 (PDF 2.81 MB) We\u2019ve reported our audit findings in our Human Rights Progress Report 2021. We\u2019ve reported our audit findings in our Human Rights Progress Report 2021. Our third-party audit process plays a crucial role in identifying issues and driving up standards in our supply chain. Each year, we provide detailed breakdowns of our audit findings against our eight salient human rights issues : health and safety, wages and working hours are the most common issues of non-conformance with our Responsible Sourcing Programme. We require our partners to put remediation plans in place for every issue identified. For details of our approach to supplier auditing, see our Human Rights Report 2020 Supplier Audit Update (PDF 1.67 MB) . More information on our Responsible Sourcing Programme can be found in our Human Rights Report 2020 (PDF 7.13MB) and also in our Human Rights Progress Report 2021 (PDF 2.81 MB) . Our Responsible Sourcing Programme includes a process of desktop and on-site audits, depending on risk. This audit process is supplemented by Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIAs) (PDF 110.01 KB) , carried out by independent expert organisations who visit a representative sample of our operations, our suppliers and other business partners. Engagement with workers is a key element of these assessments. Each of HRIA\u2019s key findings result in an action plan to address issues, with local teams assigning responsibility for leading on each issue. This may include, for example, reviewing our local planning or purchasing practices, or running local training. At the same time, we work with suppliers, or through industry or other multi-stakeholder initiatives, to address specific issues such as the eradication of forced labour, or fair terms and conditions for temporary workers or transport workers. The following case study demonstrates the critical role our RPP can play in advancing human rights for workers in our supply chain. Promoting workers\u2019 rights: the RPP in action In an audit of one of our suppliers in Malaysia, we found that migrant workers were being forced to hand over their passports to management and pay fees to gain employment. This means workers cannot leave employment of their own free will and may carry a debt for years. We raised our concerns with our supplier and arranged for workers to be reimbursed and have their passports returned. The supplier has addressed the root cause of the issue and changed its recruitment process to prevent any recurrence. It\u2019s also trained workers to better understand their rights and is working to improve its grievance mechanisms to ensure workers can raise concerns with management and seek fair resolution.

The supplier has addressed the root cause of the issue and changed its recruitment process to prevent any recurrence. It\u2019s also trained workers to better understand their rights and is working to improve its grievance mechanisms to ensure workers can raise concerns with management and seek fair resolution. Our RPP\u2019s Mandatory Requirements represent the minimum threshold we expect our partners to achieve to do business with us. We\u2019re working to demonstrate our belief that growth and sustainability are linked, by offering RPP Implementation Guidance (PDF 3.07 MB) on how to achieve the Mandatory Requirements and progress toward Leading Practices. We expect partners to work with us and to make progress from the Mandatory Requirements and Mandatory Management Systems towards the Future Mandatory Requirements and Leading Practices defined in the RPP. We know that moving up this ladder takes effort, and often requires mindset changes from our partners and their workers to address the root causes of any issues. It can also require systemic and industry change. We\u2019re working directly with our partners to build skills and develop capabilities across critical issues such as eliminating forced and child labour, paying fair wages for reasonable working hours, creating and implementing management systems, practising fire safety and protecting the environment. We also support suppliers by facilitating joint awareness initiatives on responsible sourcing innovation. We believe that committing to the requirements of our Responsible Partner Policy is the starting point in building our relationship with third parties. That\u2019s why in 2021, we introduced our RSP First programme to enhance our compliance process for suppliers. RSP First means that we only work with suppliers once they confirm they can \u2013 and do \u2013 meet the requirements of our Responsible Sourcing Programme. This avoids the risk of doing business with suppliers who can\u2019t meet \u2013 or remain compliant with \u2013 our terms. To deliver on our RSP First commitment, we created a link between our spend system and our responsible sourcing compliance system. This enables us to confirm ongoing compliance with our Responsible Sourcing Programme \u2013 or remediate any issues \u2013 before orders can be placed with suppliers. While we can \u2013 and do \u2013 block purchase orders for suppliers who don\u2019t meet the terms of our Responsible Sourcing Programme, our overall objective is not to stop business with them, but rather to drive positive behaviour change by identifying issues and helping suppliers to improve their business practices. By confirming compliance with our Responsible Sourcing Programme first, our suppliers commit to respecting human rights, conducting business lawfully and with integrity, and protecting and regenerating nature. That means from the moment we source our ingredients, materials, or services, to the moment we delight our consumers, we\u2019re working with those who share our values. Together, we can drive systemic change to promote social equity and protect our planet. Alongside worker representation, effective grievance mechanisms play an important part in hearing the voices of workers throughout our value chain. While we require our partners to provide their workers with their own robust internal procedures to raise issues, our Code of Business Principles support line is also open to third parties. That means our suppliers and distributors, their workers, or other affected stakeholders can contact us if they\u2019re concerned about any breaches of our Code (relating to the actions of our employees) or of the RPP (relating to the actions of our partners). Business integrity describes our Code of Business Principles in more detail and how to raise a concern. We also have channels available for specific sectors and industries. For example, our palm oil grievance mechanisms can be accessed by third parties in our value chain or those who support or represent them. This is described in our Palm oil grievance procedure (PDF 1.01MB) , which includes details of how to lodge a Palm oil grievance . We expect our partners and their employees or contractors to report actual or suspected breaches of our RPP. We will investigate any non-conformity reported in good faith and discuss findings with the partner. If remediation is needed, we work with the partner to identify the root causes of the issue and to develop a time-bound corrective action plan to resolve the failure effectively and promptly. By working together with partners to overcome any issues, we support the betterment of their business and, most importantly, promote respect for human rights. Protecting health and safety: the RPP in action During an audit of one of our deodorant suppliers in India, we found fire sprinklers were not installed in the factory. This meant the supplier was in breach of our RSP\u2019s Fundamental Principle 9 and was putting its workers and the operation of the factory at risk. Poor practices like this count as a \u2018key incident\u2019 and require urgent action. We raised the key incident with the supplier and agreed a remediation plan to fix the issues. Just after the installation of a sprinkler system was completed, there was a fire at the factory. Thanks to the newly installed sprinklers, the fire was contained and no one was injured.

Just after the installation of a sprinkler system was completed, there was a fire at the factory. Thanks to the newly installed sprinklers, the fire was contained and no one was injured. In September 2023 we published the first version of our Principles in support of Human Rights Defenders (HRDs) (PDF 2.9 MB) which includes complementary Implementation Guidance to support the integration of these Principles across our existing commitments and requirements. As a 'living' document, we will regularly review the guidance to update it in line with lessons learnt. We\u2019ve learned that to drive systemic change, we need to take action beyond the boundaries of our own business and supply chain. For example, we\u2019re members of the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) Social Sustainability Committee , having led the creation of its ambition on the eradication of forced labour and the creation of the Priority Industry Principles . We support the CGF\u2019s Sustainable Supply Chain Initiative (SSCI), which is working to benchmark and recognise sustainability standards. The SSCI sets a standard for the content and governance of the responsible sourcing audit standards, to increase confidence in using mutually recognised standards. As members of AIM-PROGRESS , we also work with our industry peers to support the co-creation of impactful sustainability solutions and share best practices to drive and scale positive industry-wide transformation.",
