But if Europe, and the world, really want to deliver on the\nUnited Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals (\u201cSDGs\u201d) and the European Green Deal3, the case for\ncollective action is captivating:\n- Unilateral initiatives alone cannot achieve the system change that is called for in many fields.4\n- Regulation is often desirable but not always feasible or effective, be it for lack of political\ncompromise, administrative burden, insufficient implementation or geographical limitations.5\n- Understood as a complement, international cooperation amongst industry peers has the\npotential to profoundly scale-up business contribution to the SDGs.\nCompetition policy plays a pivotal role in defining the relevant legal framework. It will encourage or\ndisincentivise collective action that goes further than voluntary self-commitments and other very\nlaudable, but often insufficient, industry initiatives. Environmental and social crisis may require closely\nco-ordinated action that likely falls within the remit of competition law, especially where:\n- Impact depends on scale - which requires bundling of resources and, most important, demand;\n- Meaningful progress may not be possible absent mandatory standards (stricter than the law);\nand\n- Systemic change (temporarily) triggers extra costs that individual companies cannot bear without\nsuffering a \u2018first-mover disadvantage\u2019. Absent a level-playing field, the most sustainable products\nwould not enter, or would vanish from the market, or survive only in often pricier niche segments.\n2.Purpose and scope of this submission to the European Commission\nUnilever welcomes the Commission\u2019s intention, expressed in relation to the Farm-to-Fork initiative,\nto clarify \u201cthe competition rules regarding collective initiatives promoting sustainability in supply\n1 The probably most frequently quoted definition of \u201csustainable development\u201d is from \u201cOur Common Future\u201d, also known as the\nBrundtland Report (1987): \"Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without\ncompromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\" (Brundtland, Report of the World Commission on\nEnvironment and Development: Our Common Future, 1987). This paper covers elements of environmental, societal and\ngovernmental (increasingly known as \u201cESG\u201d) sustainability.\n2 Consistently ranked as a sustainability leader by NGOs, Unilever\u2019s purpose-led business may serve as an example here: in\n2019, Unilever\u2019s Sustainable Living Brands \u2013 those used to support positive change for people and the planet \u2013 grew 78 %\nfaster than the rest of its business; they have continuously outperformed the average rate of growth of Unilever as well as\ngrowth of rest of the business over last 5 years.\n3 Commission, \u201cThe European Green Deal\u201d (COM(2019) 640) makes a number of references to the necessity of industry\ncontribution and collaboration to attain the objectives of the Green New Deal (see pages 8, 9 and 18).\n4 Business and Sustainable Development Commission, Better Business Better World, p. 15, available at:\nhttps://sdgresources.relx.com/sites/default/files/betterbiz-betterworld_170215_012417.pdf.\n5 See e.g. Pacheco et. al., Governing sustainable palm oil supply: Disconnects, complementarities, and antagonisms between\nstate regulations and private standards; available at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/rego.12220.\nchains\u201d6. With this submission, we wish to contribute to the broader competition policy debate around\nsustainability collaborations that is currently taking place, especially in the context of the review of\nthe Guidelines on Horizontal Co-operation Agreements (\u201cHGL\u201d). More specifically, this memorandum:\n- reflects insights from a leading European company with global activities in a wide range of fast-\nmoving consumer goods (FMCGs) that faces - and works vigorously to respond effectively to - a\nmultitude of sustainability challenges;\n- puts forward and tries to categorize examples of existing and potential competitor collaborations,\nsourced from the most pressing sustainability concerns affecting the consumer goods industry7,\nand references the Commission\u2019s and the Courts\u2019 decisional practice regarding similar types of\npeer collaborations; and\n- asks for clarifications of the Commission\u2019s interpretation of Art. 101 TFEU in relation to\nsustainability agreements, ideally in a designated section in the revised HGL, thus reverting to the\nstructural approach of the 2001 Guidelines that included a section on environmental agreements.\n3.The benefits of a predictable, progressive competition law framework \u2013 for Europe and beyond\nIn providing clarification on how European competition law applies to sustainability agreements \u2013 and,\nwhere possible, indicating safe harbours \u2013 the Commission can define limits and incite collective\naction that would otherwise not materialize for lack of legal certainty, and maybe also a \u201ccertain level\nof conservatism in the advisory industry\u201d8, as Commissioner Vestager observed. Beyond that, the\nCommission has an opportunity to pave the way for industry initiatives globally, instrumental for\nEurope\u2019s ambition to \u201ccontribute to [\u2026] the sustainable development of the Earth\u201d (Art. 3 (5) TEU):\n- Many sustainability issues European consumers care about most are either global by definition -\nthe climate crisis being the most obvious example - or they materialize in D&E markets - take\ndeforestation in the Amazon, human rights of farm workers in West Africa or the dramatic plastics\npollution in South and Southeast Asia.\n- As much as European consumers lead the way in demanding more sustainability efforts from\nbusinesses, the European Commission \u2013 arguably the most influential competition enforcer in\nthe world \u2013 is in the catbird\u2019s seat to lead by example and provide orientation for enforcers in\nother jurisdictions. Orientation that would be pertinent, as two recent examples show:\n- In 2016, the Indonesian competition authority KPPU threatened to fine palm-oil traders who\nhad decided not to buy palm oil from farmers that engaged in illegal deforestation, giving in\nto political pressure after initially endorsing the initiative9;\n- the Brazilian competition agency CADE has been urged to investigate a soy-bean moratorium\nbarring grain traders from buying oilseed from deforested areas in the Amazon.10\nCommissioner Vestager has recognized that the remit and influence of EU competition law don\u2019t stop\nat Europe\u2019s doorsteps when she flagged in 2018 that European businesses bear responsibility for the\n6 Commission, A Farm to Fork Strategy, p. 7 (unpublished draft); available at https://www.politico.eu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/FarmToForkFebruary.pdf?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&utm_campaign=88912795c3-\nEMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_03_02_05_57&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_10959edeb5-88912795c3-189131121.\n7 We are not suggesting that Unilever pursues or endorses all initiatives mentioned in this paper; the idea is to highlight a broad\nvariety of areas where collaboration could, at least in principle, have a positive impact.\n8 Vestager, keynote speech at Conference \"Sustainability and Competition Policy: Bridging two Worlds to Enable a Fairer\nEconomy\", 24 October 2019, available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mpWAOhkQbY.\n9 See https://www.straitstimes.com/world/jakarta-wants-oil-majors-to-ditch-zero-deforestation-pact.\n10 See https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-soybeans-environment/europe-says-brazils-move-to-end-soy-moratorium-\nthreatens-5-billion-market-idUSKBN1XZ1CV.\nprices paid to farmers in developing countries and for their families\u2019 livelihood - areas where, the\nnecessary safeguards in place, \u201cthe competition rules aren\u2019t there to stop that from happening\u201d.11\nII. Classification of sustainability co-operations under Article 101 (1) and (3) TFEU\nWe are aiming to categorise sustainability co-operations according to their compatibility with Article\n101 TFEU which the Commission could consider feeding into the review of the HGL.\nWe will be setting out in detail which types of sustainability co-operations we believe are unlikely to\nhave appreciable effects on markets and consumers in the sense of Art. 101 TFEU (see under 1.), and\nin which circumstances sustainability agreements that are more likely to come under Art. 101 (1) TFEU\n(under 2.) may not be subjected to Art. 101 (1) because they provide public policy benefits or\ncontribute to (other) wider objectives of the European treaties (under 3.). Lastly, we will be explaining\nwhen, in our view, agreements may be exempted under the application of Art. 101 (3) TFEU (under\n4.).\n1. Sustainability agreements that are unlikely to fall under Article 101 (1) TFEU\nA wide range of sustainability agreements are not likely to fall under Article 101 (1) TFEU for lack of\nappreciable effects: Agreements between parties whose combined market share is limited can benefit\nfrom the \u201csafe harbour\u201d thresholds set out in the current HGL and, more generally, the De Minimis\nnotice.12 The current HGL also provide useful guidance for other types of co-operation, such as\nvoluntary joint standardisation.13 However, this is notwithstanding that further clarifications in the\nHGL would be most welcome.\na. Joint commitments to achieve sustainability targets without obligations to employ certain means\nAgreements will not fall under Art. 101 (1) TFEU if:\n(i) no specific individual obligation is placed on the parties, or the parties are only loosely\ncommitted to contributing to a sector-wide sustainability target; and/or\n(ii) the parties enter into a binding agreement to achieve a certain objective but have\ndiscretion as to the technically and economically available means; the more varied such\nmeans, the more likely the cooperation to fall outside Art. 101 (1) TFEU.14\nThis category is rooted in earlier case law on sustainability collective action:\n- In ACEA15 and JAMA and KAMA16, associations of automobile manufacturers made commitments\non behalf of their members to reduce CO2 emissions from cars. The targets were set on behalf of\nall members collectively rather than individually, and as long as the average target was met, each\nmember was free to apply more or less stringent targets. Members were free to determine how\nto meet the target, allowing for the development of competing CO2-efficient technologies.\n- In CEMEP17, the principal European manufacturers of low voltage electric motors (jointly\naccounting for ca. 80% of EU sales) agreed to reduce sales of the least energy-efficient engines\n11 Vestager, speech at Conference \u201cChillin\u2019 Competition\u201d, Brussels, 20 November 2018.\n12 OJ [2001] C/368, p. 13.\n13 Commission, Guidelines on the applicability of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to\nhorizontal co-operation agreements (2011/C 11/01), para. 277.\n14 As per the previous Commission Guidelines on the applicability of Article 81 of the EC Treaty to horizontal cooperation\nagreements (2001/C 3/02), para. 185.\ne Case COMP/37.231 ACEA (1998), Commission Press Release IP/98/865, 16 October 1998.\n16 Case COMP/37.634 JAMA and Case COMP/37.612 KAMA (1999), Commission Press Release IP/99/922, 1 December\n1999.\n17 CEMEP (2000), Commission Press Release IP/00/508, 23 May 2000.\nby at least 50%. They committed to reach a specific target but had discretion on how to\ncontribute.\nThis approach provides useful guidance for a number of current industry initiatives where competitors\nare loosely committed to achieve a given objective, e.g.:\n- industry targets to reduce sugar, salt or calories, etc.;\n- the \u201cNew Plastics Economy\u201d Global Commitment of 2018, signed by more than 450 packaging\nproducers, brands, retailers and recyclers who committed (among further, less specific goals) to\n100 % of plastic packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable by 202518; or\n- the \u201c2050 Pathways Platform\u201d to develop long-term, net zero-GHG, climate-resilient and\nsustainable-development pathways, joined by governments on all levels and 196 companies.19\nb. Replacing non-sustainable products - without tangible impact on consumer price and choice\nAgreements to replace non-sustainable products or production methods generally do not restrict\ncompetition if they have no appreciable effect on product diversity and if their importance is marginal\nfor influencing purchasing decisions20, e.g. in the absence of any, or more than marginal, cost\nincreases:\n- In 2008, the Dutch competition authority (ACM) did not object to an agreement between\norganisations at various levels of the food supply chain, which resulted in members of a\nsupermarket trade organisation only selling fresh pork meat from pigs that were castrated with\nthe use of anaesthesia.21 This involved a temporary marginal increase of the wholesale price, but\nsupermarkets remained free to set their individual retail price. Slaughterhouses could still\npurchase pork meat from pigs castrated without anaesthesia for supply to other sales channels.\n- In CEMEP, the Commission found that the energy efficiency of low voltage motors was at the time\nnot subject to definitions and classifications. As such, energy efficiency wasn\u2019t a significant\ncriterion in purchasers\u2019 decisions to buy one type of motor or another. 22\nNot only the examples of this case law show that agreements between competitors to replace non-\nsustainable product settings or production processes are particularly effective:\n- Compaction (of, e.g., detergent bottles) and compression (of, e.g., deodorant bottles) \u2013\nreductions of weight and/or size of products \u2013 bring about substantial reductions of plastics and\nother packaging materials, decrease transport-induced GHG emissions and reduce the required\nquantities of ingredients. At the same time, there is no negative effect on consumer choice:\nBulkier, heavier and less environmentally friendly packaging is unlikely to be missed if the product\nfeatures remain otherwise unchanged.\n18 New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, 2018, available at: https://www.newplasticseconomy.org/assets/doc/global-\ncommitment-download.pdf.\n19 https://www.2050pathways.org/\n20 Guidelines on the applicability of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to horizontal co-\noperation agreements (2011/C 11/01), para. 186.\n21 Pig castration anaesthesia (2008), NMa Case 6456 (2008), see https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/publication/6223/NMa-no-\nobjections-against-agreements-on-the-castration-of-boars-with-the-use-of-anesthesia.\n22 CEMEP (2000), Commission Press Release IP/00/508, 23 May 2000.\n- Similarly, businesses can significantly reduce packaging materials by agreeing on higher than\nlegally required23 fill levels for instance of food containers or shampoo bottles. Again, consumers\nget a better product than before and negative effects can generally be excluded.24\nFMCG industry experience shows that consumers are initially reluctant to buy compressed/compacted\npacks as they wrongly assume that they get less value for money, or to recognize (or even notice) the\nobvious upsides of higher fill levels \u2013 the case for collective action is thus particularly strong.\nFurther examples where the cost impact on final products is likely to be marginal include:\n- The harmonization of packaging formats to facilitate recycling, or, for instance in the food\nsolutions industry, the standardization of refillable buckets to create a circular economy.\n- Joint commitments to ensure living wages for workers, i.e. an income that meets basic needs\n(which in many emerging economies is not the case for statutory minimum wages).\n- Commitments to respect labour law standards (specifically for migrant workers) where existing\nregulations are poorly enforced (e.g. on hazelnut plantations in Turkey, to name a commonly\nevoked example).\nc. Creating new markets\nThe most impactful sustainability efforts are often only economically viable if competitors bundle and\njointly create resources and demand, be it (i) for R&D required for product innovation, (ii) the\ncollective demand for the development of a product mature enough and facilities sizeable enough for\nscaled production, and/or (iii) logistics infrastructures that, too, depend on scale. In such instances of\nnew market creation there will generally be no restriction of competition if the parties would not be\ncapable of conducting the activities in isolation and there are no alternatives available.25\n- The DSD case was about a countrywide collection and packaging recovery system in Germany.\nContractors had to supply DSD exclusively and at a pre-set price. The Commission endorsed the\nco-operation agreements on the basis that they were necessary for \"the establishment of a new,\nfunctioning market in the recovery of sorted plastic and composite packaging\".26\nLooking at some of the currently most pressing sustainability challenges, the following examples\nmay be helpful in delineating where agreements to create new markets would fall outside Art. 101\n(1):\n- Chemical (or \u201cmolecular\u201d) recycling27 is frequently put forward as the most effective response to\nthe shortage of conventional post-consumer recycled plastics and surfactants which are largely\ninsufficient to meet a surging demand, especially for plastics that fulfil regulatory requirements\nof the FMCG industry (\u201cfood-grade\u201d being one of the most onerous ones). While mechanical\nsolutions inevitably lead to \u201cdowncycling\u201d to lower quality plastics, chemical recycling technology\nallows to reprocess highest-quality polymers. Collective action in this field could entail:\n23 Regulatory requirements vary significantly between countries and are often not very specific with regard to the fill levels, or\nnon-existent.\n24 Both examples come with the obvious, but no less important caveat that companies agreeing on compaction/compression or\nfill levels may not in any way collude on the commercial implementation; Case COMP/39.579 - Consumer detergents,\nCommission Decision of 13 April 2011.\n25 Guidelines on the applicability of Article 81 of the EC Treaty to horizontal cooperation agreements (2001/C 3/02), para. 187;\nCase E-3/16 - Ski Taxi SA v Norwegian Government, Judgment of 22 December 2016, para 98.\n26 Case COMP D3/34493 \u2013 DSD, Commission Decision of 17 September 2001, para 114.\n27 I.e. plastic waste is broken down to original building blocks to remove color and impurities and then to create new high-quality\nplastics. The process is fully circular as it can be repeated over and over again.\n- establishing adequate joint waste collection & sorting infrastructures for (chemically)\nrecyclable plastics \u2013 often lacking even in EU member states, let alone in D&E countries;\n- creating demand to take prototype technology to a level where mass production becomes\nviable \u2013 through volume commitments and/or joint sourcing.\n- A pledge by industries such as carmakers to only buy carbon-neutral steel28: The procurement\ncosts for steel would increase significantly but the impact on the price of the final product would\nbe limited \u2013 a market for carbon-neutral steel could be created via a specific demand route\ndownstream, thus not weakening the price competitiveness of European steelmakers.\n- Joint introduction of refill stations for reusable packs in supermarkets, be it via dispensing product\nbars or machines for consumer refill.\n- Reflecting core ambitions of the Commission\u2019s Farm to Fork initiative29, creating markets for more\nenvironmentally sustainable, healthier foods to fix fundamental shortcomings in diets of European\nconsumers (too few vegetables, too many calories), in agricultural practices (limited crop\nrotations, poor climate change adaption) and livelihoods of farming communities would consist\nof a concerted diversification into more nutritious and varied foods, translating into e.g.:\n- collective commitments to buy \u2013 e.g. through joint procurement bodies/alliances \u2013 certain\nvolumes of foods that drive the cultivation of more diverse crops30, thus creating the\nnecessary demand for farmers to start planting them and develop technological expertise\nand commercially viable input supply chains;\n- bundling of volumes to create a (currently often non-existing) logistics infrastructure for crop\ntransportation from producers to processors and/or manufacturers;\n- joint commitments to use defined quantities of crops in products dedicated for European\nconsumers and to deploy joint efforts improving acceptability of new, healthier crops.\n- Mutual - or unilateral - granting of open source access to IP to develop more sustainable\nproducts\nCompanies increasingly embrace the benefits of sharing proprietary information with peers in order\nto improve environmental efficiency of products and production processes across the industry.\n- In EUCAR, the Commission endorsed a research cooperation, particularly on environmental\nissues, between leading European motor manufacturers. The intellectual property derived from\nthe project would be freely accessible and usable by all participants. The Commission saw the\nagreements outside Art. 101 (1) TFEU as the research was at the pre-competitive stage, and the\nproducts obtained from it were not directly usable in a specific type of vehicle.31\nThe HGL should clarify that open source co-operations do generally not fall under Art. 101 (1) TFEU\nwhen the objective is a higher degree of environmental friendliness of the product.\n- Consumer goods-industry relevant examples for open sharing of innovations and intellectual\nproperty are compaction and compression (see also under b.); in fact IP rights might be granted\neven unilaterally \u2013 technological advantages could otherwise be tainted by consumer reluctance\nto switch to more sustainable products for (unjustified) fear of buying a less effective alternative.\n28 See https://www.camecon.com/blog/carbon-neutral-steel-making/.\n29 See https://ec.europa.eu/food/farm2fork_en.\n30 See, for example, the Future50Foods identified by WWF and Unilever-brand Knorr;\nhttps://www.wwf.org.uk/sites/default/files/2019-02/Knorr_Future_50_Report_FINAL_Online.pdf.\n31 Case No IV/35.742 \u2013 F/2 \u2013 Eucar OJ [1997] C 185/05.\ne. Adherence to \u2013 not or poorly enforced \u2013 laws and regulations\nCompliance with applicable laws is a seemingly straightforward expectation from responsible\nbusinesses. However, insufficient adherence to legislation up and down the value chain has proven a\nkey impediment to sustainable business in many D&E markets where government enforcement\npowers are often weak. Agreements between competitors aimed at contributing to compliance with\nlaws should be considered legitimate and outside of the Article 101 (1) TFEU prohibition \u2013 the impact\non competition is not greater than if the law were properly enforced. This is true both for\n(i) agreements between competitors regarding their own adherence to legislation; and\n(ii) corresponding agreements between competitors to demand legal compliance from\nsuppliers and other business partners.\nA few examples where the positive sustainability impact of agreements to comply with laws is\nparticularly strong, and a clarification that they are outside Art. 101 (1) TFEU would be most useful:\n- Labour-law protected human rights of farm workers in the economically most disadvantaged\nareas (for instance vanilla farming in Madagascar or cocoa plantations in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and\nGhana). Such laws cover a wide range of issues, from bans on slave and/or child labour to\nminimum wages and health and safety regulations;\n- Deforestation legislation which applies to the cultivation of commodities such as palm oil, soya,\nbeef or pulp and paper.32\n- Looking at the root causes of poor law enforcement in these, and many other, fields, corruption\nfeatures as one of the most prevalent concerns, despite the univocal recognition of the economic\ndamage it causes. Collective action can help mitigate the problem, e.g. via agreements to:\n- adhere to (often poorly enforced) anti-bribery laws \u2013 and to require the same from supply\nchain partners;\n- if necessary, blacklist suppliers or modify the terms of business with non-compliant entities;\n- explore and potentially agree on other protective measures.\n- Similar considerations apply to other integrity-related legislation, from money-laundering\nregulations to restrictions of unfair advertising. Competition laws, last not least, are another\nrelevant example given the persistent lack of antitrust enforcement in many young jurisdictions.33\nf. Exchanges of sustainability-related information between competitors\nThe success of individual companies\u2019 sustainability efforts depends largely on access to pertinent\ninformation. A clarification that certain types of data exchanges fall outside Art. 101 (3) TFEU would\nbe valuable, e.g. regarding business partner compliance with environmental or integrity legislation:\n- Establishing central open source systems to conduct due diligence and monitoring of third\nparties:\n- Joint mapping of harvesting locations and deforestation incidents;\n32 It is widely acknowledged that deforestation (particularly through forest fires) is predominantly due to insufficient enforcement\nof existing laws, not a lack of legislation; see https://www.dw.com/en/lax-law-enforcement-causing-indonesias-forest-fires-\ngreenpeace/a-50460060.\n33 OECD, \u201cGlobal Forum on Competition: Challenges Faced by Young Jurisdictions\u201d (Eighth Meeting, 2009); available at:\nhttps://www.oecd.org/daf/competition/GFC2009-Challenges-faced-by-young-competition-authorities.pdf.\n- Joint tracing of slave/child labour practices and other human rights violations outside and\nwithin the EU (e.g. in the trucking sector), notably regarding recruitment agencies; e.g. on\nthe basis of joint risk-scoring systems and vetting processes;\n- Collaborative and syndicated systems for anti-bribery due diligence and monitoring of\nsuppliers and other business partners.\n- Sharing of information regarding blackspots for bribe solicitation, either private or public, and\nabout third parties that have been blacklisted for corrupt practices by other companies.\n- Sharing of good practices, systems and tools to risk assess, control or monitor business activities\nfrom a sustainability perspective.\nOf course, any information exchange would have to exclude commercially sensitive information,\nnotably insights into competitor\u2019s commercial relationships with any of the business partners\nregistered in jointly used tools, e.g. though Chinese walls, decentralized distributed ledgers (e.g.\nblockchain) and/or involving independent third parties as service providers.\n2. Agreements that might come under Article 101 (1) TFEU\nSustainability agreements should of course be caught by Art. 101 (1) TFEU (and not exempted under\nArt. 101 (3)) if the cooperation does not truly concern sustainability objectives but rather uses these\nobjectives as a pretext to engage in a disguised cartel: price fixing, the limitation of output or sales, or\nthe allocation of markets or customers.\nOn a very different note, the potentially most transformational sustainability co-operations between\ncompetitors can potentially fall under Art. 101 (1) given their appreciable effects on competition (and\nin some instances potentially due to restrictions by object)34; they may be admissible under the\nconditions outlined below under 3.35 and 4. This section attempts to cluster such arrangements that\nmight have restrictive effects on competition into three categories; whether they will actually be\nrestrictive will of course require a case-by-case analysis:\na. Phasing-out of non-sustainable products with relevant cost increases\nThe following collaborations correspond to 1.b. but carry a higher likelihood of appreciable effects:\n- The initiatives that were subject to the Commission\u2019s CECED case36 (concerted outsourcing of less\nenergy-efficient washing machines) as well as the ACM\u2019s Energieakkoord case37 (about a deal\nbetween four electricity producers to close down older coal-fired power plants to cut CO2\nemissions) - both were deemed to fall under Art. 101 (1) and/or its Dutch equivalent.\n- Industry commitments to use only those types of plastics in packaging that are deemed safe for\nrecycling, thus phasing out e.g. PVC or oxo-degradable additives.\n- Collective commitments to (completely) replace conventional with products meeting certification\nor other defined sustainability requirements.38\n34 For agreements that are not mere disguised cartels however, the Court interprets the concept of \u201cby object\u201d infringement\nrestrictively (Case C-345/14 - Maxima Latvija v Konkurences padome, Judgement of 26 November 2015). Agreements that\npursue a legitimate sustainability goal should therefore be assessed on their effect.\n35 In those instances, restrictive agreements would, technically speaking, remain outside Art. 101 (1) TFEU (at least in the case\nof 3.a.).\n36 Commission decision of 24 January 1999, (Case IV.F.1/36.718 CECED) OJ [2000] L 187/47, p. 47\u201354.\n37 ACM, Energieakkoord\u201d (2013), available at: https://www.acm.nl/sites/default/files/old_publication/publicaties/12082_acm-\nanalysis-of-closing-down-5-coal-power-plants-as-part-of-ser-energieakkoord.pdf.\n38 Regarding Lidl\u2019s failed attempt to introduce Fairtrade bananas unilaterally, see https://www.bananalink.org.uk/news/lidl-\nbacks-away-from-fairtrade-bananas/.\n- Temporary fishing moratoria to stop overfishing and ensure long-term survival of fishing industry\nand biodiversity.\n- Moratoria on conversion of natural habitats to put an end to, for example, soy expansion into\nnatural habitats in Latin America.\nb. Setting of \u2013 mandatory \u2013 sustainability standards & standards stricter than the law\nVoluntary standardization agreements can benefit from the safe harbor rule in the HGL39 or are\nunlikely to bring about appreciable effects on competition (see above under 1.b.). However,\nmandatory standards in the following areas are potentially covered by Art. 101 (1):\n- A concerned cold-chain warm-up, i.e. an industry agreement to -10 to -12 Celsius freezer\ntemperatures for a wide range of frozen products (to reduce energy consumption & improve\nfreezer utilization).\n- The integration of regenerative and low carbon farming practices into binding common\ncertifications standards agreed amongst commodity traders and FMCGs; this could include (1)\nagreed criteria for premiums paid to producers that comply with certain practices and/or deliver\na specific impact, as well as (2) grounds for exclusion of suppliers that are not willing to remediate.\n- Collective commitments on the integration of vulnerable parties in the supply chain, including\ntransparency and reporting obligations; again, criteria could be defined in a certification\nstandard.\n- Mutually binding commitments to replace virgin plastics by recycled plastics.\n- Collective commitments to replace conventional flexible packaging \u2013 which cannot be recycled\nwith today\u2019s processing technology \u2013 with mono-materials (e.g. all-polyethylene) which are fully\nrecyclable, e.g. for sachets (without foreclosing future solutions for innovative materials).\n- Uniform industry-wide definitions of claims such as \u201csustainably sourced\u201d.\nIn a similar vein, cross-industry commitments to adhere to standards stricter than the law may fall\nunder Art. 101 (1), for example:\n- Bans on marketing of sugary snacks to children or bans on animal testing that exceed current\nregulatory requirements.\n- Commitments to lower than legally required CO2 emissions, e.g. among car manufacturers.40\n- Agreements to impose stricter than legally required integrity standards on supply chain partners\n(outside EU): e.g. living wages, stricter than legal health & safety / \u201cdeforestation-free\u201d standards.\n- Commitment between competitors not to engage in bribery, anti-competitive practices, etc. in\nthe absence of legislation (outside EU).\nc. Joint voluntary investments or payments to offset negative environmental or social impact\nIn various fields, industry peers are exploring the benefits of joint financial contributions to advance\nsustainable objectives; depending on the relative amount of the envisioned payments, the\ncorresponding arrangements may or may not come under Art. 101 TFEU:\n39 Under the current HGL(2011), competitors can enter into standard-setting agreements, provided that participation in the\nstandard-setting is unrestricted, the standard is set through transparent procedures, there is no obligation for participants to\ncomply with the standard, and any third party can obtain access to the standard on FRAND terms \u2013 in line with the \u201csafe harbour\u201d\nconditions for standardisation agreements determined by the HGL.\n40 See https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/climate/trump-california-automakers-antitrust.html.\n- In ZVEI/Arge Bat41, the Commission endorsed an industry-financed take-back and recycling\nscheme for used batteries; the (variable) disposal costs would be an integral part of the price and\nshown separately on producer and importer invoices.\n- Industry-funding of plastics collection infrastructures \u2013 e.g. through voluntary extended producer\nresponsibility schemes \u2013 helps respond to the ubiquitous lack of collection systems in many\ncountries (most conspicuously in South and Southeast Asia); this is a waste issue but also a root\ncause for a chronic shortage of recycled feedstock that is a pre-condition for a circular economy.\n- The \u201cSea The Future\u201d initiative foresees voluntary industry contributions payable on plastics\nproduced from fossil fuels. The is idea is to increase demand for plastic waste to drive collection\nefforts and the development of recycling technologies competitive against plastic from fossil\nfuels. The funds raised will be channeled into new recycling technologies, collection\ninfrastructure, and the recovery, where possible, of existing marine and terrestrial pollution.42\n- Higher than legally-required emission payments to offset negative climate impact and support\nindustry-wide \u201ccarbon-neutral\u201d claims.\n- Joint business contributions to finance officially recognized and/or third party-certified labor and\nenvironmental inspectors (outside the EU), notably where regulations \u2013 on, e.g., labor conditions\nor deforestation \u2013 exist but enforcement is ineffective due to lack of government resources.\n3. Sustainability agreements that pursue legitimate public policy goals and wider treaty objectives\nThe European courts have developed a line of cases where agreements had an appreciable effect on\ncompetition but were not subjected to Art. 101 TFEU. The following section tries to draw conclusions\nfrom the courts\u2019 case law for sustainability agreements. 43\nWe ask the Commission to explain, in the revised HGL, its views regarding the admissibility of\nsustainability agreements in the light of the below referenced decisional practice and treaty\nprovisions.\na. Recognition of public interests within Art. 101 (1) TFEU by the European courts\nBuilding on the Wouters judgement44, the Court of Justice has held that Art. 101 (1) TFEU does not\napply to certain restrictive practices between competitors if they serve a legitimate public interest,\nsuch as: ensuring the integrity and proper practice of the legal/pharmaceutical profession45,\nprotecting the fairness of sports against doping practices46, or upholding the quality of accountancy\nservices47.\nIn assessing whether co-operation pursues a \u201clegitimate object\u201d48 in that sense, the Court established,\ni.a. in Meca-Medina, a reasoning that equally applies to sustainability agreements: If rules that \u201cwere\nadopted [\u2026] for competitive sport to be conducted fairly\u201d49 in order to \u201censure healthy rivalry\n41 Case IV/F1/36.172 - Arge Bat [1998], OJ C172/13 (ZVEI/).\n42 Minderoo Foundation, \u201cGlobal industry initiative launched to end plastic pollution\u201d, 25 September 2019, available at:\nhttps://www.minderoo.org/minderoo-foundation/news/global-industry-initiative-launched-to-end-plastic-pollution/.\n43 For a comprehensive overview and thorough analysis of the Courts\u2019 and the Commission\u2019s decisional practice see Nowag,\nEnvironmental Integration in Competition and Free Movement Laws (2016), 215ff.\n44 Case C-309/99 - Wouters and others, Judgment of 19 February 2002.\n45 Ibid.\n46 Case C-519/04P - Meca-Medina and Majcen v Commission, Judgment of the Court of 18 July 2006.\n47 Case C-1/12 - Ordem dos T\u00e9cnicos Oficiais de Contas v Autoridade da Concorr\u00eancia, Judgment of 28 February 2013.\n48 Case C-519/04P - Meca-Medina and Majcen v Commission, Judgment of 18 July 2006, para. 45.\n49 Ibid, para 43.\nbetween athletes\u201d 50 and \u201cto safeguard equal chances, [\u2026] the integrity and objectivity of competitive\nsport and ethical values in sport\u201d 51 are outside Art. 101 (1), then collectively agreed (minimum)\nstandards to safeguard other sustainable business practices should not be treated differently.\nAdopting this reasoning for \u201cadherence-to-laws\u201d agreements (above under 1.e.) is particularly\nstraightforward given the purpose of, e.g., anti-corruption laws to protect ethical and fair competition.\nBut it doesn\u2019t take much to transfer the concept to other societal or environmental sustainability\ngoals. It would therefore be helpful if the revised HGL clarified that joint industry commitments are\noutside Art. 101 (1) if and to the extent that they create and protect the longer than short-term\nrequirements that ensure a sustainable \u2013 or \u201chealthy\u201d \u2013 level-playing field between competitors.\nb. Sustainability arrangements pursuing objectives covered by European treaty objectives\nBeyond the Meca-Medina logic which permits to qualify sustainability goals as \u201clegitimate objectives\u201d\ncapable of preventing the application of Art. 101 (1) TFEU, \u201cevery provision of Community law must\nbe placed in its context and interpreted in the light of the provisions of Community law as a whole\u201d52.\nI.e. sustainability objectives should be considered in Art. 101 TFEU, as expressed in the European\ntreaties:\n- most prominently in Art. 11 TFEU that states that \u201cenvironmental protection requirements must\nbe integrated into the definition and implementation of the Union\u2019s policies and activities, in\nparticular with a view to promoting sustainable development\u201d [emphasis added].\n- According to Art. 3 (3) TEU the Union shall work for \u201cthe sustainable development of Europe\nbased on [\u2026] a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment. [\u2026]\nIt shall promote social justice and protection.\u201d Art. 3 (5) TEU articulates the global scope of this\nambition, stating that the EU shall \u201ccontribute to [\u2026] the sustainable development of the Earth\u201d.\nSince Cassis de Dijon, the Courts have developed a sophisticated framework to balance environmental\nprotection and other horizontal integration clauses with the market freedoms. State aid law, too, has\nbeen addressing environmental protection since the 1990s. And the Courts have held \u201cthat\nenvironmental protection requirements must be integrated into the Community policies [\u2026] which\ninclude competition policy\u201d53, reflecting \u201cthe principle whereby all Community measures must satisfy\nthe requirements of environmental protection\u201d54. Guidance from the Commission55 on its reading of\nArt. 101 TFEU in the light of the treaties\u2019 sustainability objectives would be most valuable.56\n4. Admissibility of sustainability agreements under Article 101 (3) TFEU\nIn case an effects assessment does lead to the conclusion that an agreement is caught by Article 101\n(1) TFEU, and where the block exemptions namely for pre-market R&D agreements57 or for production\nspecialisation58 don\u2019t apply, the HGL should provide guidance where the promotion of sustainability\n50 Ibid, para. 45.\n51 Ibid, para 43.\n52 Case 283/81 - CILFIT Srl v Ministry of Health, Judgment of 6 October 1982, para. 20.\n53 Case T-210/02 - British Aggregates v Commission, Judgment of 7 March 2012, para. 117.\n54 Case C-62/88 \u2013 Greece v Council, Judgment of 29 March 1990, para. 20.\n55 Further to its 2010 Report on Competition Policy which stated (on page 32) that \u201canother essential area where competition\npolicy has evolved to take into account a long-term challenge to the Union is in the protection of the environment and the\npromotion of sustainable growth. [\u2026] the Commission has ensured that competition policy supports the shift towards a more\nsustainable economy.\u201d\n56 For a detailed and conclusive analysis on the balance of the environmental integration clause in Art. 11 TFEU, the market\nfreedoms, state aid and competition law see Nowag, Environmental Integration in Competition and Free Movement Laws\n(2016).\n57 Regulation (EU) 1217/2010, OJ [2010] L 335.\n58 Regulation (EU) No 1218/2010, OJ [2010] L 335 .\nobjectives has the potential to outweigh the negative effects of the cooperation on competition in the\nsense of Art. 101 (3) TFEU. We follow below the structure of Art. 101 (3) TFEU and its elements to\nhighlight which considerations we believe the Commission should take into account.\na. 1st condition of Art. 101 (3) TFEU: Sustainability benefits as economic benefits\nMany competitor collaborations lead to direct cost efficiencies that are easily addressable under the\ncurrent HGL; the energy cost savings brought about by the concerted outsourcing of less energy-\nefficient washing machines in CECED59 are a good example. As another example, more regenerative\nfarming practices by smallholder farmers (see example under 2.b.) lead to higher yields.\nWe believe the Commission should recognize more explicitly that qualitative efficiencies - where the\nvalue is created in the form of new or improved products, greater product variety, etc. - are relevant\nunder Art. 101 (3) TFEU. From a consumer perspective, a more sustainable product is often a better\nproduct so that product sustainability itself is a qualitative benefit. In a similar vein, the Dutch\ncompetition authority (e.g. in Chicken of tomorrow60) and the OFT have acknowledged that animal\nwelfare, product biodegradability or \u201crainforest friendliness\u201d can be qualified as direct economic\nbenefits if consumers place a value on those features.61 To the extent that collectively agreed\nsustainability criteria reflect European laws or standards, their application elsewhere should also be\ntaken into consideration as a a positive objective, as warranted for by Art 3 (5) TEU.62\nSimilarly, especially environmental co-operations will often contribute to technical and economic\nprogress in the sense of Art. 101 (3) TFEU.63\nIt would also be most helpful if the HGL would provide the Commission\u2019s take on negative externalities\nthat are reduced through sustainability co-operations. Negative externalities, e.g. plastics waste or\nCO2 emissions, and their impact on subsidized or unpriced resources (e.g. water), are costs that may\nlargely be indirect from the perspective of the individual consumer of a given product - but they are\nvery real: someone will pay them, though often not the manufacturers or the consumers but society\nas a whole. Should these tremendous costs64 really be excluded from the benefits test under Art. 101\n(3) TFEU, as current decisional practice suggests?65\nThese considerations may also illustrate why price-centric analysis within Art. 101 (3) TFEU would risk\nbeing counter-productive in respect of environmental and societal concerns: Excessively low prices\npose a threat to scarce resources and discourage sustainable land use practices. Similarly, when\nlooking at the most vulnerable members of the least advantaged societies, a strong case can be made\nfor the merits of higher commodity prices \u2013 as long as they translate indeed into improved livelihoods\nand working conditions brought about by collective action.\n59 Commission decision of 24 January 1999, Case IV.F.1/36.718 (CECED), OJ [2000] L 187/47.\n60 ACM, \u201cACM\u2019s analysis of the sustainability arrangements concerning the Chicken of Tomorrow\u201d (2015), available at\nhttps://www.acm.nl/en/publications/publication/13789/ACMs-analysis-of-the-sustainability-arrangements-concerning-the-\nChicken-of-Tomorrow/.\n61 Ibid; OECD, \u201cPolicy Roundtables: Horizontal Agreements in the Environmental Context\u201d (2010), p. 102.\n62 \u201cIn its relations with the wider world, the Union shall uphold and promote its values and interests [\u2026].

See Minderoo Foundation, \u201cGlobal industry initiative launched to end plastic pollution\u201d,\navailable at https://www.minderoo.org/minderoo-foundation/news/global-industry-initiative-launched-to-end-plastic-pollution/.\n65 While in CECED, the Commission explicitly recognized negative externalities; Commission Decision of 24 January 1999\n(Case IV.F.1/36.718 CECED) OJ [2000] L 187/47, para. 56.\nUntil the turn of the century, the Commission repeatedly and consistently recognized sustainability\nbenefits as benefits in the sense of Art. 101 (3), even if they wouldn\u2019t meet narrow consumer welfare\nstandard requirements.66 The revision of the HGL presents an opportunity to revisit assumptions made\nover the last two decades and to clarify the scope of Art. 101(3) with a view to the horizontal\nintegration objectives anchored in the treaties (above under 3.)67 and, correspondingly, Commission\npolicy priorities as articulated namely with the European Green Deal.\nThe Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC)68 has accepted environmental benefits\nto a large extent when assessing arrangements between competitors. The cases are remarkable in\nthat industry agreements were cleared that foresaw fixed levies on consumers - on greenhouse gas\nrefrigerants in one case and on the sale of agricultural or veterinary chemicals to fund programs for\nthe collection and disposal of unwanted, empty chemical containers and chemicals in another.69\nAccording to the ACCC, the positive impact on Australia\u2019s efforts to comply with international climate\ncommitments and on effective waste disposal respectively justified the imposition of the levies.\nThe Australian approach may also serve as a blueprint in that it demonstrates that economic benefits\ndo not have to be explicitly quantifiable in all instances. The ACCC, when assessing the levy program\nfor chemical waste, held consultations and obtained submissions from state and commonwealth\nagencies and agricultural and veterinary industry associations that showed great support for the\nprogram. Environmental and societal impact valuation methods70 can often deliver more scientifically\nsound results, including for negative externalities71, and there is a wealth of data available on short\nand longer term economic benefits of sustainable practices.72\nConceptually, however, there is no legal basis in the EU for concluding that non-quantifiable benefits\nare less relevant than quantifiable benefits. Courts and competition authorities should exercise their\njudgment in evaluating these benefits. In the words of senior Commission official Maria Jaspers,\n\u201csustainability goals can be taken into account if they are valued by the consumer that is being harmed\nby that arrangement. Balancing done in that context is certainly not restricted to a mathematical\nexercise of clearly identified quantified price and profits.\u201d73\nb. 2nd condition of Art. 101 (3) TFEU: Fair share for consumers\nConsumers clearly receive their fair share of the benefits whenever they are the immediate and only\nbeneficiaries, e.g. in the event of direct cost savings and qualitative improvements which are\nconsequences of sustainability arrangements between competitors.\n66 Ibid; Case COMP D3/34493 - DSD, Commission Decision of 17 September 2001, para. 148: environmental benefits as\nconsumer benefits.

The following alternative readings might be helpful:\n- Where co-operation brings about globally tangible benefits, such as reduced CO2 emissions, the\nfact that EU consumers generally also benefit should lead to a presumption that they are\nreceiving a fair share of the benefit. The Commission has recognised this, even in circumstances\nwhere the direct purchasers of goods derive no particular benefit from the goods themselves.74\n- In EACEM75, the Commission qualified a joint commitment of TV and video recorder\nmanufacturers to reduce energy consumption when on stand-by mode as restrictive but\nendorsed energy saving and environmental benefits as representing technical and economic\nprogress which would be passed on to consumers: Indeed, where individual and potentially\nmore-than-individual benefits come together, it seems adequate to assume that consumers\nreceive their fair share.\n- The 2011 HGL recognized benefits not only at an individual but also an aggregate consumer\nlevel.76\n- The CFI has held that so-called out-of-market benefits may well fall under Art. 101 (3) TFEU.77 The\nbenefits of this holistic approach are striking when looking at the Energieakkoord decision78\nwhere the ACM found that higher costs for consumers of EUR 75 m p.a. through increased energy\nprices weren\u2019t offset by air quality improvements in the Netherlands amounting to EUR 30 m p.a.\n\u2013 thus disregarding effects outside the territory of the Netherlands and positive impact in\nneighboring member states, the EU more generally, let alone the positive effect on global climate\nchange.\n- A review of the Energieakkoord case79 may have inspired the ACM to recognize, in its \u201cVision\ndocument\u201d, benefits that \u201ccover an extended period of time, and if they occur within a larger\ngroup than the current consumers of the relevant product\u201d.80 In other words, the ACM now opens\nthe door for the consideration of (1) out-of-market benefits, thus deviating from the path taken\nin Energieakkoord81 and Chicken of tomorrow82, as well as (2) benefits for future consumers or,\nmore generally speaking, positive effects which will materialise with a time lag.\n- Such future benefits are of particular practical importance: Most examples of joint commitments\nto voluntary payments put forward above under 2.c. are unlikely to produce immediate benefits.\nRather, increased investment in measures for better plastics recycling, strengthening workers\u2019\nhuman rights or improving their livelihoods materialize and literally pay out at some point in the\n74 Commission decision of 24 January 1999 (Case IV.F.1/36.718 CECED), OJ [2000] L 187/47, para. 56.\n75 European Commission, XXVIIth Report on Competition Policy (1998), p. 152.\n76 Guidelines on the applicability of Article 81 of the EC Treaty to horizontal cooperation agreements (2001/C 3/02), paras.\n193.194.\n77 See Case T-86/95 - Compagnie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale maritime and Others v Commission of the European Communities, Judgment of 28\nFebruary 2002.\n78 ACM, Energieakkoord (2013), available at https://www.acm.nl/sites/default/files/old_publication/publicaties/12082_acm-\nanalysis-of-closing-down-5-coal-power-plants-as-part-of-ser-energieakkoord.pdf.\n79 Ibid.\n80 ACM, \u201cVision Document: Competition & Sustainability\u201d (May 2014), p. 16, available at\nhttps://www.acm.nl/sites/default/files/old_publication/publicaties/13077_vision-document-competition-and-sustainability-2014-\n05-09.pdf.\n81 Ibid.\n82ACM, ACM\u2019s analysis of the sustainability arrangements concerning the Chicken of Tomorrow\u201d(2015), available at\nhttps://www.acm.nl/en/publications/publication/13789/ACMs-analysis-of-the-sustainability-arrangements-concerning-the-\nChicken-of-Tomorrow/.\nfuture. But we don\u2019t think they should be disregarded within Art. 101 (3) TFEU. Societal and\nenvironmental sustainability is a marathon, not a sprint, since goals are often not immediately\nattainable. The Commission has adopted a similar logic with the 2030/2050 milestone arguments\nof the European Green Deal83 - wouldn\u2019t it be both timely and coherent to include future\nconsumers in the consumer concept of Art. 101(3) TFEU?\n- Probably not every relatively distant economic efficiency should receive the same weight in the\nArt. 101 (3) TFEU test as an immediate, quantifiable benefit. A possible remedy might be to\nassume that the greater the time lag, the greater the efficiencies must be.\nc. 3rd condition of Art. 101 (3) TFEU: Indispensability\nCooperation between competitors must be necessary to attain sustainability objectives. In many of\nthe examples put forward in this paper, collective action will indeed be indispensable in that sense:\ni. Whenever only collective demand enables the creation and development of sustainable\ntechnologies or infrastructures:\n- The basic R&D for chemical recycling has been around for years, but the investment required\nto refine and mature the technology has kept undertakings from pursuing its development.\n- Creating effective supply and logistics structures for healthier and more environmentally\nsustainable foods may not be feasible without joint action and pooled purchasing power.\nii. Where individual businesses \u2013 even with comparatively strong buying power \u2013 lack the necessary\nleverage to induce systemic changes required in supply chains:\n- Fishing moratoria are an instructive example as they only work if respected by everybody.\n- Experience shows that child and slave labour and other human rights violations in the supply\nchain cannot be eliminated absent industry-wide bans and rigorous, coherent action against\nnon-compliant suppliers in the most disadvantaged jurisdictions with poor law enforcement.\n- Similarly, many suppliers will not agree to pay living wages as long as there are customers\nwilling to accept exploitative working conditions.\n- In the face of public and private governance weaknesses, corrupt practices will persist absent\na consistent and potentially concerted zero-tolerance approach across industries.\niii. Where individual companies are ready to consider pioneering new technologies or standards but\nare deterred by the risk of first-mover disadvantages84:\n- Compaction is an illustrative example: studies, as well as Unilever\u2019s experience, confirm that\nconsumers don\u2019t switch to smaller packs if conventional packs remain available since they\n(wrongly) assume to get more value for money.\n- Similar concerns apply to other initiatives outlined under 2. \u2013 from cold-chain warm-up for\nfrozen products to a conversion to plastics packaging that is more easily recyclable:\nVoluntary standardisation can only attain piecemeal improvements, if at all, while\nmandatory standards may be indispensable to establish a level-playing field.\n83 Available at https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2050_en.\n84 Ref. e.g. Business and Sustainable Development Commission, Better Business Better World, p. 55: \u201cBusiness leaders that\nchoose to align their strategy with the Global Goals anticipate that, sooner or later, their business will start to incur costs that\ntheir competitors don\u2019t face. This is true across all industries. In commodity sectors, current low prices are aggravating cost\npressures, making it hard for progressive businesses to \u2018internalise\u2019 environmental or social costs that competitors are not\nwilling to bear. Even in more differentiated sectors, such as consumer goods, cost pressures are intense, partly because of\nslow growth in middle-class purchasing power\u201d.\n- International and sometimes global collaboration will often be a precondition for change\ngiven the risk of supply shifting to countries with lower standards if the stricter ones are only\napplied on a limited geographic scale.\niv. Where only collective voluntary financial efforts of industry peers create the incentives or\ninfrastructures for the most impactful sustainability measures:\n- In the example of the \u201cSea the Future\u201d initiative (under 2.c.), contributions payable on\nplastics produced from fossil fuels are necessary to increase demand for plastic waste and\nthus to drive collection efforts and the development of recycling technologies.\n- When downstream infrastructures \u2013 e.g. for collecting and sorting of plastics waste \u2013 are\ninsufficient, and where governments lack the means to establish them, collective industry\nefforts and investment can turn out to be the only remedy.\nIt is true that consumers increasingly consider sustainability to be part of the quality dimension of a\nproduct (see above under a.). Consequently, a more sustainable product delivers a competitive\nadvantage to companies if consumers are willing to pay a mark-up for the associated costs. And while\nthis works often particularly well for premium and/or niche products, consumers of mass market\nbrands have proven less inclined to embrace higher prices for more sustainability:\n\u201cConsumers in general rely on companies to meet basic environmental and social standards in their\noperations, allowing them to get on with hunting down the best value. They don\u2019t pay attention to\nhow products are made every day.\u201d85\nIn other words, collective action may be indispensable especially where willingness-to-pay surveys\nalone cannot capture consumer awareness and appreciation of the sustainability of sourcing,\nproduction and the product itself. This is likely to be the case for the biggest segments of consumer\nmarkets, and the most scaled cross-industry initiatives. Clarification from the Commission as to how\nto resolve the tension between such transformational sustainability co-operations and the consumer\nwelfare approach that currently governs the application of Art. 101 (3) TFEU would be critical.\nConversely, upfront and coherent collaboration (e.g. through certification and labelling) can be a\nprecondition for consumer acceptance, giving consumers reassurance that the claimed superior\nsustainability performance of the product is not based on arbitrary or biased criteria of individual\ncompanies.\nSustainability labels and more generally the promotion of environmental and societal objectives\nthrough collective industry initiatives may also be indispensable to enable SMEs to adopt more\nsustainable sourcing standards or production methods that they otherwise couldn\u2019t afford to\nintroduce given their lesser financial clout compared to bigger companies.\nA common feature of many sustainably agreements (notably those aimed at creating new markets\n(2.c.)) is their limited duration. Once a new product/production methodology has gained foothold, the\nco-operation could and - unless relevant efficiencies justify an extension - should be dissolved.\nd. 4th condition of Art. 101 (3) TFEU: No elimination of competition\nSustainability agreements must not lead to an elimination of competition in terms of products or\nprocess differentiation, technological innovation or market entry. Co-operations which only cover a\nsmall part of the relevant market are by definition unable to eliminate competition. But even broader\nco-operations with a more than marginal impact on costs and thus price competition do not\nnecessarily eliminate competition - provided that the co-operation does not wholly determine retail\n85 \u201cThis makes it very difficult for an individual company to raise its standards on its own, even though many might want to be\nbetter employers and stewards of the environment. All the players have to agree to raise and maintain standards at the same\ntime to keep the playing field level.\u201d (Business and Sustainable Development Commission, Better Business Better World, p.\n56.)\nprices and that there are other significant competitive parameters on which the parties can continue\nto compete in other ways, i.e. by way of a combination of factors such as price, quality, innovation,\nbranding, etc.\nAny co-operation to achieve sustainability objectives should be strictly limited to that which is\nnecessary for those objectives, and safeguards must be put in place to ensure that the co-operation\ndoes not spill-over into other areas. The parties must remain wholly free to compete on all other\nparameters of competition.\nContact details:\nUnilever\nDirk Middelschulte, Global General Counsel \u2013 Competition\nRue d\u2019Idalie 11-13\nB-1050 Bruxelles\ndirk.middelschulte@unilever.com\n",
