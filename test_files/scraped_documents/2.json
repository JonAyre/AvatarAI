Around 3.4 billion people use our products every day. We use many different crops to make our products \u2013 and millions of people play an important role in providing them. Securing a sustainable supply of these materials is a key goal in our sustainability strategy. The Unilever Sustainable Agriculture Code (SAC) (PDF 7.88 MB) and the Unilever Regenerative Agriculture Principles (RAPs) provide the basis for our sustainable sourcing programme. The SAC is a collection of best practice principles for farming that hundreds of thousands of farmers have used since 2010 to make their operations more sustainable. But despite years of implementation, the SAC has not been enough for us to solve all the sustainability challenges in our agricultural supply chain \u2013 from decline in soil health to biodiversity loss. We recognised a need to go further. This is why in April 2021 we introduced the Unilever Regenerative Agriculture Principles (PDF 8.34 MB) , which provide guidance on how to nourish the soil, capture carbon and restore and regenerate the land. We aim for these to inspire our business, brands, our suppliers and peers \u2013 and form the basis for regenerative programmes for ingredients in our supply chain. Every material we purchase is covered by our Responsible Partner Policy (PDF 4.45 MB) which applies to all suppliers. It embodies our commitment to responsible, transparent and sustainable business. The RPP sets out our 17 Fundamental Principles and defines the Mandatory Requirements, Mandatory Management Systems and Future Mandatory Requirements that partners must meet or exceed to do business with Unilever. In 2023, 79% of key agricultural materials [a] were sourced sustainably. Our key crops make up two-thirds of agricultural raw material volumes we buy. Below we provide more detail on the actions we're taking. We work with a range of stakeholders to help develop internationally recognised standards and verification systems like the Rainforest Alliance, trustea, The Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS) and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). We also work with farmers and suppliers, and with consumers to stimulate demand for sustainably sourced ingredients. Wherever possible, we\u2019re seeking better visibility on the ground, which gives us and our stakeholders added confidence that the crops in our supply chain are sustainably grown. The palm oil industry has a number of sustainability challenges that, as founding members of the RSPO, we have been working to address. As a major palm oil buyer, we have a key role to play in transforming the industry to stop deforestation , improve transparency and traceability, and support farmers \u2013 especially smallholders \u2013 to adopt more sustainable practices. Visit our palm oil section to find out how we are working to make sustainable palm oil commonplace. As part of our commitment to the sustainable sourcing of our key agricultural crops, we aim to buy 100% paper packaging that comes either from well-managed forests or from recycled material. But sometimes we need to source virgin paper and board. For example, because of safety regulations. When we do, we buy from certified sources with a full 'chain of custody' from the plantation to us. This gives us complete oversight of the journey our raw material has taken to get to us from its origin. We achieve this either through certification schemes, like the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), or other national schemes under the framework of the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). In 2023, 98% of our directly purchased paper and board packaging materials were made from recycled fibre or came from certified sustainably managed forests. Our research shows that consumers prefer products made with sustainable oils \u2013 so sourcing our oils sustainably can help grow our business as well as reduce our impacts on the environment. Soy oil is a crucial ingredient in our brands, such as Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise, enjoyed by consumers the world over. In 2023, 100% of our soybean oil was sustainably sourced. We are founding members of the Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS). Since 2010, the development of the RTRS standard has enabled farmers to improve their practices and gain accreditation. Our purchase of some of the first RTRS certificates was an important step towards ensuring a sustainable supply of soy oil. We believe transparency is essential to a more sustainable supply chain. Our soybean supplier list gives details of our direct suppliers, accounting for more than 99.9% of our soy oil purchases. Most of the soy oil we buy comes from soybeans grown in the US and Brazil - this is also where most of our engagements around soy are focused, as we have identified our priority sourcing landscapes in soy according to materiality and risk. In each region, we work with farmers, NGOs, our suppliers, other agri-businesses and governments. We also aim to contribute to the development of international standards which recognise farmers and suppliers for their efforts to address the big issues associated with soy production, which vary across regions. In Latin America, for example, unsustainable soy production is associated with habitat loss and deforestation. We\u2019re collaborating with partners on long-term RTRS projects that encourage better social, environmental and agricultural practices and help us work towards ensuring our supply chain is deforestation-free. In Brazil, we are part of a collaboration with the Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS) and Alian\u00e7a da Terra, which has helped more than 40 farmers to gain RTRS certification. This collaborative project aims to boost sustainable soy cultivation by supporting growers to adopt better farming practices. Bayer CropScience provides technical services and crop management advice, and Santander provides support for agricultural loans while Yara advises on best use of fertilisers. We help boost the market for sustainable soy by buying the resulting crop. In the US, soil health and water quality are a particular focus for our farmer programmes. These programmes have supported hundreds of soy farmers to improve soil health, water quality and yields by using regenerative methods such as planting cover crops. We can\u2019t make our foods without high-quality vegetables from all over the world. A reliable supply of the best ingredients is essential to the long-term future of food brands that people can trust on taste, nutrition and sustainability. We buy significant quantities of tomatoes, onions, pumpkins, leeks, green beans, mushrooms, potatoes, celeriac, peas and carrots, as well as herbs such as basil, parsley and chives. Most of the vegetables we buy are used in the soups, sauces and other food products made by our Knorr brand. With such a wide range of ingredients, we need a diverse supply chain. We buy our vegetables and fruit from around 500 suppliers, who in turn buy from around 50,000 growers and farmers. Our expert buyers seek the best quality ingredients from growers around the world. The scale and diversity of this supply chain gives us a great opportunity to make a positive environmental and social impact. But at the same time, it creates complexity when it comes to ensuring a sustainable supply of vegetables \u2013 especially as climate change impacts production, prompting us to look for new sources for ingredients. This complexity is reinforced by the fact that currently there is limited availability of vegetables certified as sustainable. So working in partnership with others is critical if we\u2019re to source our ingredients sustainably. We work closely with our farmers and suppliers to help them meet the Unilever Sustainable Agriculture Code (SAC) standard and our new Regenerative Agriculture Principles, or we recognise equivalent standards, provided they match our own. We also support many wider partnership initiatives to drive improvements. For example, we helped establish the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) Platform . The SAI helps us identify links with other fast-moving consumer goods companies who buy from the same suppliers, and agree common standards. Our brands are working to protect and preserve natural habitats in the places their ingredients are produced. Knorr continues its work with farmers and growers through a new series of 50 projects. Part of our Climate & Nature Fund, the projects aims to establish regenerative agriculture sourcing for 80% of Knorr\u2019s key raw materials over five years. One project, for example, is using satellite data and digital sensors to help tomato farmers in the south of Spain optimise their water use and improve soil health through cover cropping. Cocoa is a vital ingredient for many of our brands. We're working with partners to source sustainable cocoa so that we can meet consumer demand. 99% Of our cocoa is sourced through certification schemes such as the Rainforest Alliance and Fairtrade Cocoa is a global commodity with a complex supply chain. Cultivating cocoa provides livelihoods for millions of people, but is also associated with issues such as deforestation, water impacts and human rights risks \u2013 issues we want to play our part in eliminating. However, we cannot change the supply chain just by acting on our own. Partnerships and collaborations are an essential part of our approach. In particular, we work with suppliers through long-standing certification schemes like the Rainforest Alliance. These have helped drive standards across these sectors and are a powerful tool when it comes to monitoring sustainable agricultural practices. We've made significant progress through certification of cocoa, which we mainly use in\u00a0our ice cream brands such as Magnum, Wall\u2019s and Ben & Jerry\u2019s. The Rainforest Alliance works to conserve biodiversity and improve smallholder farm practices through its Sustainable Agriculture Standard. The Standard promotes ecosystem conservation, worker rights (including the prohibition of child labour), safety and wildlife protection. It also covers topics like water and soil conservation, agrochemical reduction, legal wages and contracts for workers. Now 99% of our cocoa is sourced through certification schemes such as the Rainforest Alliance and Fairtrade. We buy around 1.5% of the global production of cocoa, mainly sourced from\u00a0C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and\u00a0Ghana. We currently source 99% of our cocoa sustainably\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but we know we need to go further to generate systemic change. This is why we've set ourselves the goal of going further, through impact programmes that complement the work of certification programmes and bring us closer to the people who grow our ingredients. We have already mapped over 87% of our dedicated farmer group supply chain, together with our suppliers, to improve traceability and better understand where our cocoa comes from. We publish our direct suppliers in our Unilever Tier 1 and Tier 2 Global Cocoa Suppliers - Direct Sourcing 2022 (PDF 420.5 KB) . By 2025, we aim to have reached\u00a0at least\u00a0a third\u00a0of the\u00a0cocoa\u00a0farmers in our\u00a0direct sourcing with\u00a0tailored\u00a0impact programmes that have three key aims: Cocoa supports the livelihoods of an estimated 5.5 million farmers. For many cocoa farmers, lack of access to training and other services results in poor yields, which in turn can lead to farmers switching crops or leaving farming and moving to urban centres in search of better jobs. We want to invest in long-term solutions to ensure that sustainable cocoa farming is supporting farmers and their communities. Some of our work involves helping farmers prepare for certification \u2013 but we also deliver impact programmes that specifically aim to help farmers improve and build a more sustainable way of living. We help farmers with tailored business plans and access to finance and training - and we have a target of reaching 6,000 farmers with income diversification training and opportunities by 2025. We have already piloted a number of programmes that explore alternative crops and new income streams in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. We\u2019re working to eliminate child labour from all our supply chains through our Responsible Partner Policy (PDF 4.45 MB) . We know that child labour exists within the cocoa sector, so we have developed impact programmes with our partners, certifiers and suppliers to ensure that our dedicated cooperatives have monitoring and remediation systems in place that assess and address child labour cases. By end of 2023, all the cooperatives in our dedicated supply chain had such system in place. Empowering women is critical for child labour prevention. We want to reach 2,000 women in cocoa households through training and income diversification opportunities to support this work. We are also committed to increasing the number of village savings and loans associations in the communities we source from, since we believe that they are critical in tackling child labour and helping cocoa farmer households improve and sustain their livelihoods. Cocoa is one of the five priority crops where we are working towards a deforestation-free supply chain . Certification schemes like Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade and UTZ help us to manage risk. We also partner with 35 other companies as part of the Cocoa & Forests Initiative to champion forest protection and restoration. We offer a number of tools to our suppliers to help them embed more sustainable sourcing practices: The Cool Farm Tool : This tool calculates the greenhouse gas balance of farming, including emissions from fields, inputs, livestock, land use and land use change and primary processing. It\u2019s ideal for farmers, supply chain managers and companies interested in measuring and reducing their agricultural carbon footprint. Biodiversity Action Plan: The Unilever Sustainable Agriculture Code (PDF 7.88 MB) requires our suppliers or farmers to prepare a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP). We have prepared guidance that should be useful to all those who are preparing BAPs as it provides a standard, structured approach. We buy beet sugar and cane sugar from countries spanning Asia, the Americas, Europe and Africa, each of which can have very different supply chains and challenges. While we\u2019re proud of the progress we\u2019ve made, in the longer term, our aim is to help create a global supply of sustainable sugar. We believe the best way to achieve this is to harmonise the sustainable sourcing codes of the food and drink industries and forge them into a single standard, which can have an impact at scale. That\u2019s why we have helped develop the Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA) through the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) Platform ,\u00a0which has been agreed by many businesses in the food and beverage industries and gives farmers a single, simplified sustainability framework to work to assess and improve their farm performance. We support the Bonsucro standard, which aims to improve standards of production in the cane sugar\u00a0industry, including by increasing the proportion of physically\u00a0certified sugar from sugar cane. We continue to buy\u00a0Bonsucro\u00a0credits while working with\u00a0Bonsucro\u00a0and others in the Americas and Asia to apply a combined approach of credits and certifying supply chains. Dairy farms are important parts of our brands' ingredient supply chain, particularly for our ice cream business. We encourage high standards among the farmers we source from \u2013 including standards of animal welfare, greenhouse gas reduction and biodiversity management. See Farm animal welfare for more on how we\u2019re working to achieve higher welfare standards for farm animals. Our Unilever Sustainable Agriculture Code (SAC) and Regenerative Agriculture Principles (RAPs) set out requirements for suppliers and farmers of all our raw materials, including dairy. Our Livestock Implementation Guides were developed with the help of our external partners FAI Farms (Farm Animals Initiative) in 2013. They outline specific advice for livestock farming and animal welfare. For our dairy farmers, we provide extra guidance including on the treatment of cows and calves, pasture management, and the management of manure, silage, run-off and other nutrient sources, as well as pesticides and veterinary medicines and many other criteria. We support this guidance with training for farmers, including in the use of the Cool Farm Tool, which assesses emissions of greenhouse gases; the Cow Compass (a way of monitoring animal welfare); and advice on how to set action plans to improve energy use and enhance biodiversity. In addition, Caring Dairy is our continuous improvement programme for the farmers who supply the milk and cream for Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream in both North America and Europe. Suppliers and farmers around the world are achieving Unilever\u2019s sustainable dairy standard. But farming is rarely the same in two places \u2013 so while we have a shared set of standards, our approach can look very different from one farmyard to another. Our dairy ingredients come from large farms, from cooperatives and from smallholders who might own between two and five cows \u2013 so one size does not fit all. We\u2019re now working on a model to roll out this programme, including through flagship farms which demonstrate the improvements for other farmers. With the Dairy Farmers of America, we\u2019re also trialling an approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while improving animal health and welfare. Over the last few years we have explored the benefits of a probiotic feed additive with one of our suppliers, with the aim of reducing emissions of methane. At the same time as working with farming groups and individuals, we want to collaborate across the sector to achieve higher sustainability standards. We work with the Dairy Sustainability Framework, developed by SAI Platform, which seeks to create a holistic approach to sustainability in the global dairy value chain and align the goals of buyers and producers. This has led to the launch of the Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP). The SDP is what is known as a 'business-to-business' sustainability model, bringing us together with other buyers, and with suppliers representing 30% of global milk volume. It\u2019s built on the Dairy Sustainability Framework\u00a0(DSF) and its 11 criteria addressing sustainability issues. The SDP also requires all milk processors to address the prevention of deforestation, the protection of animal welfare and human rights, and compliance with local legislation. Regenerative farming requires system-level changes to the way farmers manage their land. Ben & Jerry\u2019s Caring Dairy initiative aims to encourage and support practices like this on dairy farms. It has helped cooperatives supply ingredients for Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream in Europe and the US since the brand co-founded the initiative in 2002. It aims to support thriving livelihoods for farmers and farm workers, excellent care for cows, and a flourishing ecosystem that combats climate change through building soil health and sequestering carbon. Farmers who manage to improve are compensated, based on a third-party audit. Beyond meeting Caring Dairy\u2019s Basic Requirements, farmers can reach Silver or Gold level performance, with increasing reward for each level. Ben & Jerry\u2019s Caring Dairy programme asks dairy farmers to measure themselves against 12 indicators of sustainable and regenerative agriculture \u2013 and keep improving. Examples of best practice include planting cover crops to reduce soil erosion, planting without tilling the land (and so keeping more carbon in the soil) and reducing fertiliser use. Tea forms a key part of our goal to achieve a deforestation-free supply chain . Increasing the proportion of certified tea we buy is crucial to helping us reach our goal \u2013 as certified tea gives us a traceable source of supply back to the farmer. By the end of 2023, 79% of all our tea was sustainably certified by Rainforest Alliance, or trustea verified. Both of which offer us traceability and allow us to stipulate a fully segregated supply chain. To improve traceability of tea supplies, trustea is piloting tracetea in Assam and South India, a mobile application incorporating block chain technology to track tea from smallholder farmers\u2019 fields to the factory gate. It will increase the visibility of tea from smallholders, who provide a substantial proportion India\u2019s tea. We also want consumers to understand where their tea comes from, because transparency is a key ingredient in our ambition to make the tea industry fairer and more sustainable. Greater scrutiny of our supply chains helps us work more effectively with partners and suppliers to bring about positive change. Back in 2019 we took an important step towards this when we began to publish an annual list of all our global suppliers (PDF 691.85 KB) of black and green tea. 2022 saw the introduction of the trustea seal on some of our brand packs, another important move in assuring our consumers that the tea they choose is produced with care for the environment, safety and livelihoods. In 2007, we supported Rainforest Alliance to develop local indicators for sustainable tea production in Kenya. We began to certify our tea farms, helping to transform both our own supply chain and the wider industry. We became the first major tea company to commit to sustainably sourcing tea on a large scale, and our Kericho estate in Kenya was the first tea farm to achieve Rainforest Alliance certification. Today, Rainforest Alliance Certified\u2122 tea accounts for around 20% of world tea production. We\u2019ve long believed certification is one of the important ways to drive positive change in tea supply chains. We\u2019re India\u2019s largest tea business and a founding member of trustea , the Indian tea industry collaboration on sustainability. trustea covers all aspects of tea manufacturing, supporting sustainability and competitiveness by improving productivity, quality and safety standards. Through its Sustainable Tea Programme, both smallholder farmers and tea estates are encouraged to adopt more sustainable practices. Nearly 65% of India\u2019s tea production was trustea verified in 2022, and we buy both trustea verified and Rainforest Alliance CertifiedTM tea. We know there are many deep-rooted and longstanding issues in the tea industry. Our aim is always to respect and value the human rights of tea workers and smallholder farmers, and work to improve their health and financial security while protecting and nurturing the land they rely on. We\u2019ve learned that we can only achieve the systemic change required if we work in partnership with others, from tea growers, suppliers and NGOs to local and national governments and the wider industry. Tea workers and farmers depend on the land to grow their tea \u2013 and we're committed to nurturing it so that future generations will continue to benefit. With our suppliers, we work on nature-based projects like smart agriculture, water conservation and pesticide reduction. Together, we're building programmes that implement sustainable and regenerative farming practices including improving soil, crop quality, biodiversity and reforestation. In Assam, the state that produces around half of India\u2019s tea, we worked with our suppliers and UN Women to prevent and respond to gender-based violence, including sexual harassment, in tea estates and surrounding communities. The programme took a holistic approach, targeting men and women workers and their families, to reach around 15,000 workers and nearly 300,000 community members.

Following work in Assam and experience in Kenya, UN Women, with our support, created A Global Women\u2019s Safety Framework in Rural Spaces\u00a0(PDF 6.53MB) . Published in 2018, it\u2019s available to the global tea industry and other value chains, supported by a practical Guide on implementation. Following work in Assam and experience in Kenya, UN Women, with our support, created A Global Women\u2019s Safety Framework in Rural Spaces\u00a0(PDF 6.53MB) . Published in 2018, it\u2019s available to the global tea industry and other value chains, supported by a practical Guide on implementation. With IDH, the Sustainable Trade Initiative, in 2020 we created the Women\u2019s Safety Accelerator Fund . It\u2019s an innovative impact fund that supports tea producers and partners in India to set up mechanisms to address gender-based violence, strengthen prevention and support women\u2019s empowerment in the tea gardens, accelerating the take-up of the UN Women Global Women\u2019s Safety Framework in Rural Spaces.

In the tea industry, there are worrying incidences of human rights abuses, including violence against women, and worker wages are often low. We\u2019ve put innovative programmes in place to tackle these issues, working with others to promote change across the sector. We\u2019re a member of the Ethical Tea Partnership , a not-for-profit organisation which brings together the tea industry with development partners, NGOs and governments to improve the lives of tea workers, farmers and the environment in which they live and work. We\u2019ve set a strategic goal on living wages and living incomes for our suppliers. Following our analysis of where the gaps to achieving living incomes are largest, we\u2019re piloting our Global Living Income Programme in our tea supply chain. Workers in the tea sector often suffer from poor nutrition, lacking diversity and sufficient vitamins and minerals in their diets. We joined forces with the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition ( GAIN ) and IDH \u2013 the Sustainable Trade Initiative in 2016 to develop Seeds of Prosperity , a programme promoting the consumption of a nutritious, balanced diet in India. Today we\u2019re building on this experience to promote not only better diets but better hygiene practices too. Working with GAIN, the Ethical Tea Partnership and several tea companies, we\u2019re now co-funding Healthy Diets for Tea Communities . The programme adopts a twin-track approach, using a behaviour change campaign on diet and handwashing alongside action to increase supply and access to more nutritious food in Assam. It plans to reach 110 tea estates with nearly 170,000 workers over 2021-2023, and has reached around a third of this number so far. By working with our suppliers and the extraction industry on traceability and standards for responsible sourcing, we aim to increase our positive social impacts while building trust in our brands' supply chains. Many of the raw materials we use each year to make our products are classified as non-renewable. Around 6 million tonnes of these originate from minerals or metals extracted from the earth \u2013 around half the non-renewables we buy originate in India and China. However, the extraction and processing of minerals are sometimes associated with human rights issues. Our Responsible Partner Policy (PDF 4.45 MB) guides us in managing our risks to ensure we have supply chains that consumers can trust. We have a three-part approach to sourcing these non-renewable materials: As we\u2019re not a major player in the area of mineral extraction, we work with suppliers and other industry players to collectively drive responsible sourcing of these materials. We\u2019ve been working on this area for a number of years, which culminated in the creation of the Code for Responsible Extraction (CORE) that we co-created in 2015 with the NGO Solidaridad, as well as supplier and industry partners. CORE offers a globally acceptable and credible assurance to buyers and other stakeholders that industrial minerals are extracted in a responsible way. It\u2019s independently audited and helps suppliers make continual improvements towards five objectives: There are 12 key agricultural crops in scope of this metric, originating from agriculture or forestry. These can be purchased in different forms, blends and derivatives. Our key agricultural crops are: cocoa, coconut oil, dairy, cereals and starches, palm oil, paper and board, rapeseed oil, soy oil, sugar, tea, vanilla and, vegetables and herbs.",
