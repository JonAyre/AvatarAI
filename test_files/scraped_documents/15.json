Ms. Sara Ellison, Ms. Dania Sauza and Mr. Nigel Hol-\nloway have provided tremendous support to the development of the examples profiled in this resource. We thank them\nfor their dedication and excellent work. Special thanks to Lord Michael Hastings, Mr. Simon Appleby and the KPMG\nCitizenship team and for their continued support of the UN Global Compact; and for their leadership and support of\nthe Resource Package Mr. Lynton Richmond, Mr. Emad Bibawi, Mr. Jim Low, Mr. Barend Van Bergen, and Ms. Esther\nRodriguez and Ms. Lissa Mitchell.\nAbout the United Nations Global Compact\nThe United Nations Global Compact is a call to companies everywhere to voluntarily align their operations and strate-\ngies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption, and\ntotake action in support of UN goals and issues. The UN Global Compact is a leadership platform for the development,\nimplementation and disclosure of responsible corporate policies and practices. Launched in 2000, it is largest corpo-\nrate sustainability initiative in the world, with over 12,000 signatories based in 145 countries.\nAbout the Principles for Responsible Investment\nThe United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) Initiative is a network of international\ninvestors working together to put the six Principles for Responsible Investment into practice. The Principles were\ndevised by the investment community and reflect the view that environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues can\naffect the performance of investment portfolios and therefore must be given appropriate consideration by investors\nif they are to fulfill their fiduciary (or equivalent) duty. In implementing the Principles, signatories contribute to the\ndevelopment of a more sustainable global financial system. Launched in 2006 by UNEP Finance Initiative and the UN\nGlobal Compact, the Principles provide a voluntary framework by which all investors can incorporate ESG issues into\ntheir decision-making and ownership practices and so better align their objectives with those of society at large.\nAbout KPMG\nKPMG member firms are some of the world\u2019s leading providers of audit, tax and advisory services. Operating in 156\ncountries, KPMG culture and values are aligned with the UN Global Compact\u2019s ten principles and are at the heart of\nhow they conduct business. Globally, KPMG is using its capacity and capability as an international network to support\nsustainable development, working strategically with governments, non-government organisations and the private sec-\ntor to make an impact. KPMG understands that responsible business practices contribute to broad-based development\nand sustainable markets.\nCopyright \u00a9 2013\nUnited Nations Global Compact Office\nTwo United Nations Plaza, New York, NY 10017, USA\nEmail: globalcompact@un.org\nThe material in this publication is copyrighted.

It\nalso discourages investment. Yet the innovation and economic development which the private\nsector brings can be a powerful agent of positive change, provided the activities are responsible\nand sensitive. Mobilizing companies around universal values to take action is one key to ad-\nvance peace. Peace in the absence of economic development is difficult to achieve or maintain.\nSince 2009, the UN Global Compact, together with the Principles for Responsible Investment\n(PRI), has facilitated the private sector, civil society and academia in the development of the\n\u201cGuidance on Responsible Business in Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas\u201d. The present\nresource builds on this cornerstone and has been developed to offer a practical understanding\nof the types of actions and measures expected from responsible businesses operating or with\nan interest in high-risk areas. It showcases examples in which companies, investors as well as\nGlobal Compact Local Networks have used the Guidance to progress in their journey towards\nsustainability. \u201cResponsible Business Advancing Peace\u201d is intended to help understand how\neach party can make a positive contribution to peace.\nThe past few years have been marked by significant progress. More companies are taking up\nthe challenge of advancing human rights, environmental protection, anti-corruption and\nhigher labour standards - displaying an ever stronger commitment to corporate sustainability\nin high-risk areas. Responsible businesses are taking measures to understand conflict dynamics\nand design policies that better integrate conflict-sensitivity in such operating environments.\nBusinesses are increasingly looking for venues where they can contribute towards peace build-\ning and make a positive impact on the economic and social life of local communities, while\nestablishing and growing markets.\nThe investment community has enormous potential to drive corporate sustainability perfor-\nmance. There is a clear movement away from calling for divestment from troubled areas to-\nwards rewarding companies that adopt best practices in the protection of human rights, social\ndevelopment and governance. Responsible investors are increasingly willing to engage in con-\nstructive dialogue with companies on peace-related issues and to work together to develop an\napproach that ensures success, develops business and contributes to peace and development.\nPerhaps the most promising development lies with the ever stronger engagement of local ac-\ntors on the ground, their strengthened connection and collaboration. Global Compact Local\nNetworks are increasingly becoming powerful hubs where companies and others can share\nexperiences and focus on the critical factors for each particular country.\nThere is no single recipe for success, but there are many ways in which the private sector\nand networks can make a positive difference. As a new platform \u2013 \u201cBusiness for Peace\u201d - is\ntaking shape to support meaningful engagement and action, it is hoped that this compilation\nof examples from companies, investors and Global Compact Local Networks from around the\nworld will help all committed actors to understand how they can bring principled business and\neconomic development to countries and local communities, bringing mutual benefit and the\nadvancement of peace.\n5\nForeword from PRI Executive Director\nJames Gifford\nWeak rule of law, human rights abuses, economic instability and corruption are some of the\nchallenges companies face when operating in conflict-affected and high-risk areas. Although\nthere is no single definition of a \u201cconflict-affected\u201d or \u201chigh-risk\u201d area, the investors featured\nin this report agree that the terms include regions where there is political or social instability,\nviolent conflict or abuses of political and civil liberties. Failure to adopt responsible business\npractices can cause reputational damage, or lead to loss of social licence to operate or accusa-\ntions of complicity in human rights abuses.\nHowever, business and investment in these regions can play a part in the development of a vi-\nbrant economy, which is often the only way out of the poverty that is both a driver and an out-\ncome of conflict. Many post-conflict areas have great potential for growth as they re-establish\nthe rule of law and take other steps to boost business confidence, and are therefore promising\ninvestment destinations. It is therefore essential that investors (and the multinational compa-\nnies they own) do not simply avoid investing in challenging regions, but rather adopt a hands-\non approach in seeking to invest in ways that promote stability, peace, protection of human\nrights and long-term security.\nIn 2010, the UN Global Compact and the Principles for Responsible Investment published a\nreport called \u201cGuidance on Responsible Business in Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas: A Resource for\nCompanies and Investors\u201d. This follow-up documents the experiences of seven institutional inves-\ntors who adopted the guidance in their shareholder dialogue with companies operating in\nconflict-affected areas.\nThe report shows that the benefits of responsible practice are considerable. They include:\navoiding damage to the company, improving relations with stakeholders, increasing access to\ninvestment capital and contributing to local communities through social investment programs.\nFor investors, engaging with investee companies that have a presence in these regions helps\npreserve long-term shareholder value, avoid financial and reputational risks and reduce nega-\ntive externalities.\nBut most importantly, responsible business practices help to build a culture of business ethics,\ntransparency and responsibility in economies that desperately need capital to develop, and this\nculture is what underpins business confidence and future growth and stability.\nUnited Nations:\nTranslating\nWar into Peace\ninaliM\nodnamrA\n:ngiseD\n\u00a9\nC\nM\nY\nCM\nMY\nCY\nCMY\nK\n7\nIntroduction\nThe project\u2019s purpose\nin difficult operating environments around\nAs globalization opens up remote and unde- the world.

In this context, the Guidance aims to provide a common reference\npoint for dialogue between investors and companies on what constitutes responsible\nbusiness practices in conflict-affected and high-risk areas.\nThe participants\nTo demonstrate how investors can help to promote responsible business practices in\nthese areas of the world, in these 7 case studies, investors share their experiences in\nimplementing the Guidance to engage with companies operating in conflict-affected\nand high-risk areas. The examples cover European and American investors involved in\nindividual and collaborative engagements with companies from diverse sectors (mining,\nbrewery, oil and gas, manufacturing) operating in Africa, Asia and South America.\nUsage of the Guidance and identified best practices\nThe aim of the dialogue is to influence companies to conduct their business practices\nmore responsibly through the use of the Guidance. In each example, investors were\nable to engage in a useful interaction with the targeted companies that resulted in\ngreater transparency, improved communication with stakeholders and better process-\nes. This was achieved through a variety of means, sometimes including face-to-face\nmeetings with key company personnel in the high-risk country itself.\nThe dialogues were not without challenges. Sometimes investors found it difficult to find\npublicly available information on the companies\u2019 operations in these regions. In other\ncases, companies were reticent about reporting and disclosing their practices. In some\ninstances, investors did not have the manpower to visit the site and relied on phone calls,\nemails and meetings with company executives at the head office rather than in the field.\nDespite these challenges, the examples show that investors can make significant\nprogress. The investors acknowledge that conducting business responsibly is a long-\nterm process for the companies. In these case studies, investors have demonstrated\nthat they can succeed not only in gaining further insight into the difficulties companies\nface on the ground, but also in encouraging companies to conduct themselves more\nresponsibly in high-risk areas.\n72\nF&C ASSET MANAGEMENT\nInvestor name: F&C Asset\nManagement Guidance points addressed:\nCompany engaged: Bavaria Core Business - Guidance Point #1: Companies are encouraged to take adequate steps to identify\nS.A.

REVENUE TRANSPARENCY AND DISTRIBUTION\nOil, gas and mining companies make payments directly to governments in the form of\nroyalties, bonus payments and taxes providing the state with an autonomous flow of\nfunds that is independent of citizens. The lack of revenue transparency is a major gap\nfor many producing countries and companies are potentially contributing to high levels\nof bribery and corruption as well as poor governance and development outcomes.\nOften local communities do not receive direct benefits from companies operating in the\nregion. The lack of equity in benefit distribution and transparency can also exacerbate\ntensions between the company and local community and government. The company\nshould implement and report on a revenue transparency and distribution policy to gov-\nernment and to local communities when operating in a controversial country.\n2. HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY\nA lack of a human rights policy exposes companies to potential violations and complic-\nity in human rights abuses. The company should implement a clear human rights and\nlabour standards policy and delegate a person responsible for those policies. This is\nespecially relevant in the context of conflict-affected areas as resources such as oil are\nconsidered to have national strategic importance and therefore companies are required\nby law to accept protection by government military in the transport of resources.\n3. NATIONALIZATION\nEnergy and mining companies face increased political and economic risks as govern-\nments readdress the balance of power by taking more control over their domestic\nresources, particularly in light of increasing prices for oil, gas and minerals. Potential\nproblems such as confiscation, sovereign non-payment and political interferences as\nwell as outright nationalization could threaten global oil and resource supplies and\nincur a risk for the investor. The company should demonstrate that it has addressed\nnationalization risks through the implementation of an internal policy.\n4. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT\nCompanies operating in difficult situations such as conflict or post-conflict regions\nmay inadvertently have an adverse impact on the environment and population. Some\nimpacts may be environmental in nature such as excessive use of natural resources\nthat can affect the population through harming food security or human health.\nCompanies operating in these high-risk environments should assess their current\nand future operations for adverse environmental and human repercussions and put\npolicies and systems in place to prevent their occurrence.\n89\nCHURCH OF SWEDEN AND\nSEB INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT\nInvestor name: Church of\nSweden and SEB Investment\nGuidance Point Addressed\nManagement\nCore Business - Guidance Point #3 -: Companies are encouraged to respect emerging international\nIndustry and type of operation\nbest practices, especially where national law sets a lower standard.

It provides practical ideas of how Global Compact\nLocal Networks can take action and highlights good examples.\nWhat are Global Compact Local Networks?\nGlobal Compact Local Networks are clusters of Global Compact signatories who come together\nto advance the Global Compact and its principles within a particular geographical context. These\nbusiness-led networks perform increasingly important roles in placing the Global Compact within\ndistinctive national, cultural and linguistic contexts. Their role is to facilitate the progress of compa-\nnies (both local firms and subsidiaries of foreign corporations) engaged in the Global Compact with\nrespect to the implementation of the ten principles, while also creating opportunities for multi-stake-\nholder engagement and collective action to advance UN goals. Local Networks work to advance the\ncorporate sustainability agenda through learning exchanges, information sharing, working groups,\nand by facilitating partnerships and dialogues that tackle issues specific to local contexts.\nGlobal Compact Local Network Activities\nEach Global Compact Local Network determines its own governance structure based on the fol-\nlowing criteria: guidelines provided by the Global Compact Office; activities that reflect national\npriorities; and the priorities of the signatories. Each signs an annual Memorandum of Understand-\ning (MoU) with the Global Compact Office to engage in activities consistent with the purposes and\nobjectives of the initiative, namely to:\n\u2022 Commit to the principles and practices of the Global Compact. This includes the ten principles\nthemselves, the practice of learning by doing, dialogue, partnership and striving to bring together\nother stakeholders;\n\u2022 Hold a minimum number of events/activities annually;\n\u2022 Display a willingness to support efforts by participants to develop a Communication on Progress\n(COP);\n\u2022 Proactively manage and protect the integrity of the Global Compact initiative and develop a ca-\npacity to find solutions to dilemmas faced by participants in the network; and\n\u2022 Produce an annual activities report.\nIn return, the Global Compact Office supports the local networks in all the activities that they un-\ndertake. It also ensures that they are kept updated with all the global developments and provides\nvarious engagement opportunities based on national priorities.\nHow are Global Compact Local Networks Supporting Companies to Advance Peace?\nAs Global Compact Local Networks are rooted in the local context, they are uniquely positioned to\nsupport Global Compact participants in achieving both objectives of the Global Compact \u2013 aligning\n101\nbusiness operations and strategies to the ten principles of the Global Compact and catalyzing action\nin support of UN goals and issues. This includes supporting companies with operations in high-risk\nand conflict-affected areas to ensure they live up to their commitment to the UN Global Compact.\nIt also involves engaging companies to take action to advance peace in all areas of the world.\nCompanies have many proven methods to avoid the increased risk of instability. Business often\nplays a central role in job creation, training/education, ex-combatant reintegration, weapons collec-\ntions programmes, early warning community level security arrangements, natural resource man-\nagement and multi-stakeholder dialogues. One of the most effective ways to ensure a company\ndoes no harm in these difficult operating environments is to integrate Conflict Sensitive Business\nPractices and voluntary principles into a company\u2019s strategic planning. Companies can engage with\nother international initiatives that provide guidance on making a positive contribution such as the\nKimberley Process, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and the Global Re-\nporting Initiative (GRI). Public-private dialogues have also come to the fore as a means of fostering\nenvironments that are more conducive to these contributions by companies. All of these initiatives\noffer companies a path towards advancing peace and lower the risks to their operations.\nGlobal Compact Local Networks serve as country-specific resources for companies to share good\npractice and advance the role of business in peace. Global Compact Local Networks from around\nthe world are being encouraged to pledge their support for the new Business for Peace (B4P) plat-\nform. Many have become founding participants of the platform. In so doing, they will demonstrate\na willingness to engage in learning, dialogue and collective action to advance peace in the work-\nplace, marketplace and local communities. These Local Networks will also support companies to\nimplement the ten principles in high-risk or conflict-affected areas and mobilize a range of stake-\nholders in dialogue to identify priority areas for greater corporate engagement to advance peace.\nBased on local priorities and needs, Global Compact Local Networks are supporting companies in\nseven key areas:\n1. Supporting Implementation and Disclosure Including in High-Risk/Conflict-Affected Areas\n2. Supporting Projects and Collective Action that Contribute to Peace\n3. Convening Multi-stakeholder Dialogues\n4. Organizing Awareness-raising, Campaigns and Outreach Events\n5. Customizing Tools and Resources\n6. Recognition/Awards\n7.
